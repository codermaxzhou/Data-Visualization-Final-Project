This restaurant was fairly busy and how can you go wrong with a place that has tons of meats in the window???  We decided to do the table d'hote since the price seemed pretty reasonable and we were pretty hungry.  The soup way okay and the entrees were fine.  I'll warn  you that everything including ham/bacon seems to be topped off with maple syrup.  The food was fine, nothing out of world but a-ok.  This is where things dropped off.  They had two waiters working the floor and that didn't seem to be enough.  We ate our entrees and then waited a good 20 min or so before the waiter came back and asked if we wanted the dessert course and we said yes.  Then the two ugliest nastiest ladies came in and sat at the table next to us.  They wanted to custom order EVERYTHING!  It was pretty clear to us that NOTHING would make these miserable women happy yet the waiter was going to try.  45 minutes later still no desert or any service - I guess we weren't important at all so we had to walk up to the front of the restaurant and get our bill.  They didn't understand that we were done waiting at that point (our time does have value) and weren't willing to make any adjustments for the fact that we didn't get our full meal.  Not in the mood for dessert and coffee after waiting over an hour (and yes we did start timing them).  In addition to service that went from ok to non existent the drinks at this place are ridiculous in price - it's clear that they make their  money off the beers.", "What is with all of the great ratings?! The woman who served us was rude. I ordered salade nicoise and my mom the crepe. Out came two salads and when my mom said she ordered the crepe she was rudely told \"no, you asked what was in the nicoise\". She DID ask but when told it had anchovies she ordered the crepe. There was no offer to take it back. WORSE NICOISE EVER. It's a mix of tons mayonnaise and tuna, and an egg topped with an anchovie over a bed of greens. No green beans, no potato..just awful  My stomach is off now 5 min after the meal and all I taste is fish. Don't waste your time.", "I took my wife here for lunch.  We were politely greeted and promptly seated.  The wait staff disappeared attending to other customers.  We finally flagged down our waiter who dished us off to another waitress.  The waiter blew kisses to my wife as an apology.  She was offended but I was not.  \n\nEvery single customer who entered after us was served their meals.  When we asked what was going on we finally received our soup appetizers.  I had the Onion which was Luke warm and borderline at best.  My wife had the vegetable soup du jour.  It was cold and indescribably weird.  We could not identify any ingredients, it was more like stock than soup.\n\nWe waited AGAIN for our main courses which by the way are pre-prepared (QUICHE).  When I queried what the problem was I was given a blank stare and watched in dis belief as even more tables were receiving their food.\n\nFor the first time in my life (I am 55) I actually got up, told the waitress to cancel our order, paid for our drinks and left."], "2": ["it was quite the festive atmoshere with the world cup on big screen but the staff were quite snobby bitches. I wanted to smack one of them at one point as they were quite rude to my mom. I ordered their brie sandwich which I specifically asked for them to heat up and I guess their frentch isn't all that good cause I mentioned to them en francais....the owner was a total prick. Otherwise was just an ok experience. I won't be going back again in the future though", "Went in here for a quick lunch with my family. The atmosphere and vibe was quite fun, but our food was rather disappointing. We ordered the ham and cheese crepe and croque monsieur, two simple dishes that are usually kept salty, only to have them both smothered in maple syrup. I don't know if this was Quebec twist to the dish, but I personally thought it ruined it. \n\nWe also had an order of cassoulet and it too was disappointing.\n\nThis small restaurant is essentially a tourist trap.", "Our second day in Montreal we wanted to try something different for breakfast.  Meaning, not a chain, and not just pastries and coffee/tea.  We had spied this place the other day and it looked intriguing, although the menu out front wasn't totally clear, the sign saying \"breakfast served all day\" was pretty clear.  \n\nWe were there at 9:40.  Took about 10 minutes to get anyone to notice us in the empty and freezing shop.  We were told the kitchen doesn't open until 10 (this was a weekday!).  No suggestion to sit and wait with some espresso, no offer to look at the menu.  Not a good start.  We went next door and got a drink (a missed sale! empolyees of Marche).  I convinced my dinning partner to come back and try again.  Probably was a bad idea.\n\nWhat I had was good.  Let me say that first off.  The service was not up to snuff but as long as it isn't horrible I can usually handle that.  Waiting for the cook to get to work was a bit of a trial, about 40 minutes.  The people next to us ordered croque monsieur and waited nearly an hour while the staff filled the deli case instead of making their meal.  When they complained a manager type made them in about 30 seconds.  hmmmmm... another bad sign!\n\nI tried the omelet special, which was more of souffl\u00e9.  I'm not an omelet conisure but it was nice.  The ham, bacon, cheese, pat\u00e9, fruit and bread was all good and really more than I typically have for breakfast but a nice treat.  What wasn't good was putting a salad on top of all of that on a warm plate next to the piping hot dish that held the omelet/souffle thing.  Which creates  a  wilted salad as anyone will tell you.  But here is the kicker, my companion ordered the fruit crepe.  It came out looking like a burrito, which is not the end of the world and could be interesting.  While it was filled with fresh fruit, most of that fruit hadn't been properly cleaned.  The cantaloupe still had the rind on it!  And the crepe was chrispy like it had been fried or something.  I have no idea how you do that to a crepe.  Maybe this is a regional variation I'm not aware of but when you got to hack at your crepe with a chisel to get at hard cantaloupe rind something is not Kosher.  \n\nLike the hair that was served with the crepe.  \n\nI wanted this place to be better.  It is cute and interesting and I wanted to sample all the things in their deli case.  But I'm not coming back for $15 a person breakfast that isn't served until lunch and isn't properly prepared.  Should have gotten pastries at Olive+Gourmando."], "3": ["My husband got the duck confit sandwich on French bread with lettuce and tomato which was pretty good, basically shredded duck in some crusty bread with some nice freshness and crispness from the lettuce and tomatoes.\n\nI got the French onion soup and ham and cheese quiche and mixed greens.  The quiche was delicious, the egg was nice and fluffy with a certain sweetness to it in a flaky crust.  The salad was tossed with a basic balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The servers all seemed very happy to be there, singing and dancing around, interacting and joking around with the guests, and were helpful and very nice.", "Cute spot which was one of the very few restaurants that was open early on a rainy weekend!\n\nI got their huge mug of hot chocolate, as well as the croissant.  My boo got the omelet which came with some pate.  \n\nFood was good, everything was decorated in a nice way!", "solid, not spectacular.  Good value and tasty charcuterie."], "4": ["On my way to the archeology museum today, I got a little lost in an area on Rue St. Paul, but fortuitously as it turned out. If I hadn't been off the beaten path, I probably wouldn't have passed La Villette.\n\nWhat struck me immediately in passing was the framed Bon Appetit magazine article--oh, and the word \"charcuterie\" emblazoned across the window. ;)\n\nI made my way back after the museum and decided on the Assiette La Villette, an array of cheese, pates, and a small salad. As I waited for my food, I soaked in the atmosphere. The tables were small and close together, and there was French music playing. Perhaps it was just me, but the decor seemed a bit over the top, like a Disney version of a French cafe, but the food and service were wonderful.\n\nWhen my lunch was served, the platter was covered with a selection of pate de foie gras, a country-style duck pate, duck rillettes, a pate of pork and veal, prosciutto, ham, salami, a small crock of mustard, some cornichons, brie, two local cheeses, and a small green salad. This also came with a small basket of bread. It sounds like a lot of food--and it was. And it was utterly delicious.\n\nI couldn't stop eating the pate de foie gras and the duck rillettes, as well as everything else. The country-style duck pate was my next favorite, with a bit of mustard. The pork and veal pate was my least favorite. In all, I ate far more than I should have, and had a memorably lovely lunch at La Villette.\n\nThank goodness I wasn't with my vegetarian coworkers!", "Our last lunch in Montreal was at Marche De La Villette, a decision sparked mainly by the appearance of meat and meat models hanging in the window and the sounds of accordion music escaping past the door. \n\nThe place seemed more French than the French themselves and that's quite all right--- given the quality of the lunch we had, Marche could equip their wait staff in mime costumes, blast Maurice Chevalier all day and force us to listen to the speeches of Degaulle all day and I'd still eat here.\n\nFor $14.95, you'll receive a soup, a plat principal and dessert as part of their lunch special. My wife opted for this and was quite satisfied with her choice of the choucroute (sausage, potatoes and sauerkraut-- how Alsatian!) The dessert was two mini waffles with powdered sugar that I brazenly stole.\n\nI was far more gluttonous and ordered a charcuterie plate and a croque monsieur. \n\nServed on a board, the charcuterie offered up delicious samples of brie, cheddar, sausage, turkey cold cut, chicken salad, pate and more. \n\nThere was barely enough room on our table when my croque monsieur arrived, now with bacon strips! Yes, ham and cheese alone just isn't meaty enough so the addition of bacon strips is surely welcome.\n\nWhile the menu is en francais, the staff was quite willing to explain certain dishes, especially in areas where my french is severely lacking. (Like names of specific vegetables)\n\nThe staff was definitely harried. Somehow the lunch service was harmonious, our waitress was apologetic about being late with our water refills and it all came together. \n\nThe menu includes hamburgers, sandwiches and salads. Prices in that area, for lunch, start at $9.95.", "Had the pleasure of having lunch here in July. Had the Croque Monsieur and it was by the far the best I have ever had. It came with a side salad and we ordered a quart of red wine. \n\nThe waiters and waitresses were very outgoing and the service was extremely fast given the place was packed at 12:00 in the afternoon. You litererally feel you are in France from the second you walk in the door (not to mention after 3 glasses of wine). The atmosphere is very happy and upbeat and coupled with the delicious food, it was a great overall experience."], "5": ["Another one of my favorite stops in Montreal and my favorite bistro is March\u00e9 de la Villette.  After recently browsing the internet, i noticed it was featured in food & wine restaurants and travel!!\n\nThis is the classic french bistro.  there is no bare wall in this small cafe.  The rustic walls are painted with fruits and vegetables, flowers, and trees.  The corners are adorned with life like flowers and greens.  And vintage canned foods border the restaurant, while dried meats hang above the counter. \n\nthe menu, if i remember correctly is in french, however i THINK they had english menus... its been 2 years..  the waiter was kind enough to explain the specials and the menu.  He had a thick french accent and greeted us with \"Bon apr\u00e9s midi!\" and \"Vat will you be having madame?\"\n\nwe ordered the coldcut sampler which was overflowing with prosciutto, Genoa salami, ham, roast beef, dried sausages and some other meats i cannot name.  On one corner were two little jars filled with liver pate and ham pate.  Both were equally delicious and the best i've had.  Mixed baby greens and fresh toasted baguette were nestled into the empty cracks of the platter.  mmm divine! \n\nWe also had the quiche Lorraine served with a bed of mixed baby greens, the prosciutto sandwich, tomato cream soup, and a stuffed tomato with veal (this had a fancy french name, but i didn't write it down).  it was delicious!  the tomato stuffed veal sat on top of a bed of herbed rice.  Everything was so so so good. I cant wait to visit Montreal again just so i can lunch here.  Do order wine along with your meal like the french!    \n\n I love everything about his quaint restaurant.  Its located in downtown Montreal.  The streets are narrow and lined with eroded stones.  I really enjoy the uniqueness of its location.  What a great find.  Au revoir!", "Excellent place for lunch. Their smoke meats are great. Real authentic French deli food. Haven't had such great smoked meat since I was in Paris. They also have great wine by the glass and coffee. Love this place. Huge fan!!", "This quaint little Marche has a that feel of a little Paris. Random objects clutter the walls (wooden shoes, old photos, chalkboards with different eats available, etc). And faux ham and sausage links hang in the window. There is a full deli, but I went for breakfast. Saw it just walking by and popped in. Everyone was quite nice and very cheerful. We got the fruit crepes with chocolate. Very tasty. I also like that coffee was given in a mug. I drink quite a lot of it. Not the best coffee, but definitely what I needed at the time.\nOverall, a very pleasant experience."]}}, "sOcZcXcNm8LmdoOYqEDqpg": {"reviews": {"3": ["Not bad. Came for a little brunch.

The waitress, who seemed very blas\u00e9e but who offered us a timely service nonetheless, brought us a very watery mushroom cream first, which would have been okay if the dish had been called soup instead of cream. It was the first time my husband and I had encountered a botched mushroom cream. When Tim Horton's, a fast food chain, beats you at making a proper cream, there's a problem. Moving on.\n\nWe then had a vegetarian lasagna with a side of salad. The salad itself was a bit pitiful and lifeless, tossed greens with boring ranch topping and a swirl of carrots as decoration. The lasagna was alright, but we both agreed it lacked spices, and that it felt like it had been reheated. The ingredients did not taste fresh at all. It was however filling.\n\nFinally, somehow managing to find some remaining hope in our hearts, we ordered the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e. What we were presented with somewhat looked like it, but a bite of it revealed a gelatinous pudding-like substance which was definitely unlike any cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e we ever had.

It was gross and a total failure. \n\nOther than that, the tea and coffee were surprisingly alright, but the cups were significantly stained with tea.

The main meals were awful. \n\nMy friend had the fish main, which was cut in two pieces: one piece was totally over cooked and the other was essentially raw. The pieces were separated by undercooked risotto that tasted like dirt. We sent it back and they brought her some scallops, which were nice but served with more horrible risotto, that was only slightly better cooked.\n\nMy main was a lamb in a puff pasty that had a strange flavor and a very mushy texture. It was served next to a huge pile of some slop looking purree with a weird color. It tasted alright, but was very unappetizing to look at.\n\nThe \"meal\" capped off with the worst creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've ever had.

Our first appetizer, a pretty run-of-the mill gazpacho, arrived almost 90 minutes after we had sat down, and the second one followed half-an-hour later, a full two hours after we had arrived. No apologies were proffered. The waitress showed signs of annoyance when we mentioned time concerns. I ended up leaving at 10, 2 1/2 hours after we had arrived, with no sign of my main course. My wife stayed -- apparently desserts arrived at 11:30, a full 4 hours after our arrival. No sign of contrition -- but rather a claim on the part of the waitress that something had not been payed for!

The soup option came in a large shooter glass and although it was tasty, I did not like the presentation as the soup was lumpy and the textures were definitely not shot-worthy.\n\nMy fish main was blue marlin and although it was ok, it was certainly nothing outstanding. The sauce was kind of strange/bland but at least the cous cous was done right.

The fried bananas were the star of the meal.\n\nThe second time I went the appetizer trio was fantastic. I had the duck wings, the cucumber salad (divine) and the julienne salad. I ordered the beef ramen again for dinner because I remembered it was good from last time and wasn't feeling adventurous. It came to the table in an incredibly large bowl. Filled with noodles, about 5 bok choy leafs, some green onion or scallion and a decent amount of beef. Unfortunately it was incredibly salty and smelled and tasted of eggs. There was no egg in it (sometimes a restaurant will put half a boiled egg in their ramen but this one had none) so I told the waiter. He argued with me, and refused to just let me pay for my appetizer and leave. He argued with me twice over, telling me I didn't know what japanese ramen is and that it was how it was supposed to be. I have had ramen before, even at this very restaurant and I don't think it's right to argue like that.\n\nIn the end he wouldn't let me just pay for my appetizer so he gave me some stir fried noodles and I got them to go because I had already been there for nearly an hour waiting for my soup.

The standout dish, however, was the pork spine!  \n\nI was very skeptical, but the portion size was huge and it was closer to a short rib than I would've thought.  It was tender, flavorful, and immensely filling.

The cucumber and squid was tasty, with a bit of a sesame flavor; the sweet and spicy cucumber wasn't particularly spicy but you'd probably enjoy it if you like sweet pickles; and the flavored tofu had an interesting texture but wasn't particularly sensational.\n\nThe spicy beef hotpot had thinly sliced potatoes on the bottom of the pan, carrots, and chunks of not-too-fatty beef. We ordered \"medium\" spicy and it had a pleasant, not overpowering kick. It tasted a bit of 5-spice powder, which is a nice flavor with beef. It was enough for two people to share with a bowl of rice.\n\nThe tab came out to $35, and $10 of that was beer, so the price is excellent.\n\nThe restaurant itself was kind of cold, and a section of the dining room appears to have been partitioned off for things that don't fit in the kitchen. The restaurant was pretty busy while we were there, so perhaps things have expanded to the point where not everything fits in the kitchen? So don't go there for the ambiance. The service was a bit spotty, but friendly.

All of these tacos are served the same way, a mix of grated onion, tons of cilantro and chunks of avocado and cheese. \n\nThe beef was a close second but I will definitely pass on the chicken.

There are in fact 2 torrillas underneath the fresh pile of yummy.. and we found that splitting the contents between the 2 shells made them easier to eat with our hands (mmmmm).\n\nAll tacos come served on two (stacked) soft tortillas with fresh avocado, salsa verdi, (onions), and cilantro on top of the main filling. We tried the sausage with cheese, fish, pork and lamb tacos. Having read they can be a little heavy handed on cilantro and onion- I had mine without onion. They did use lots of cilantro - but I love cilantro so it didn't bother me. \n\n The fish was nicely deep fried and crispy and the texture was a nice counterpoint to the softness of the taco, avocado and salsa Verdi on top. The lamb was super yummy... flavorful without being over salted or too spicy. (Actually it is refreshing to note that none of the tacos were over salted.) I seriously liked the pork - small chunk instead of ground with nice caramelized brown bits and slightly sweet finish. The cheese and sausage one had gooey melted cheese and a nice ground sausage. \n\nYou can tell these are assembled fresh on order.... a little slow? Maybe. But worth it. This isn't Taco*barf*Bell.\n\nPrice  (about 3 bucks per taco) versus quality is what gives this place 5 out of 5 for us... despite the (some-might-find-it-a-tad-slowish) inital service of the first round. We did appreciated the fact that they served the tacos in 2 courses instead of all at once. They were perfectly hot this way and not soggy in the least... so Rosa, our waitress, gets bonus points for that. She tried hard to please despite being a little rushed at times. \n\n We WADDLED home quite full... having consumed 4 tacos and 2 cokes  (love the bottled soft drinks... no soda fountains here) between 2 of us. Next time we will skip the second coke since we didn't finish both (and which is actually almost the price of a taco) and will consider having 3 tacos between us.

My reservation was at 7:30, they had given me 4 and a half hours notice that they couldn't do anything for me. I told the man I was speaking with that I had been assured there was something, and he really didn't seem to care. I then had to scramble to find a new reservation.\nI will never be making a reservation at La Chronique and will tell everyone I know to avoid this place. I'm shocked at how disorganized and rude La Chronique was."], "3": ["The Why:  Recommended by a Montreal contact when I inquired about a classy/classic French restaurant where I could take my mother and aunt without breaking the bank, La Chronique struck me as a great place to start off our dining in Montreal.  Knowing full well that my family does not have the same appreciation for haute-French as I, Chef Marc De Canck's take on provincial French seemed to strike a good balance between accessible and refined and with a convenient location on L'Avenue Laurier and a \"business casual\" lunch compared to the \"jackets suggested\" dinner destination I made a reservation for noon on a Monday.\n\nThe food:\n\nOregano Potato Bread, Nuts and Grains Bread, Cows Milk Butter and Fleur de Sel:  Complements of the house, served piping hot, and replenished without request the \"nuts and grains\" bread was as good as many pain au cereal in Paris while the potato bread was light, aromatic, and airy.\n\nDuo de Foie Gras de Canard / pain d'epices, puree de coing, gelee d'abricots:  My obvious choice, and a wonderful one at that, this presentation of Palmex Farm's fatted duck liver was presented both seared and en terrine.  With the warm preparation served over spiced bread quince puree and the creamy chilled portion topped with a thin piece of golden bread and brown sugar crumble there was nothing particularly elaborate about this dish, just high quality ingredients paired beautifully, the sweet cutting the fat and the aromatics perfuming the palate.\n\nFilet de Proc Fume / Polenta, Courgettes, Moutarde: My plat principal, this dish was suggested as our waitress' favorite and a chef's signature with good reason.  Again quite rustic in its construction but featuring an ample cut of lean pork loin smoked and placed over toothsome polenta tinged with mustard seeds the highlight of this dish was actually the jus - a pan reduction of bacon, zucchini, and cocoa that fit somewhere between sweet and savory thus working well to meld the pork and polenta without overpowering either.\n\nOnglet de Boeuf Angus / Salsifis, Choux de Bruxelles, Champignons:  A surprising order for my mother who rarely orders beef this was another hearty dish that would have fit nicely on any French bistro menu as the tender Alberta sourced hanger steak was cooked to medium well served over a sort of confit of Brussels sprouts and salsify with lightly pickled at the side.  With mom focusing on the steak, dense and aromatic with just a touch of smoke and char I particularly appreciated the sprouts - caramelized but still pungent and a good foil to the richness of the protein.\n\nRisotto vert-pre / Epinards, Edamamaes, Courgettes:  At first I thought my aunt was truly puzzled by my translation from French, but assuring us she wanted the vegetarian offering of the afternoon I must say it turned out quite nicely with the Carnaroli rice cooked to a medium tenderness in a creamy reduction of mushrooms and peas before being garnished with chopped zucchini, shelled edemame, and shredded spinach.  Rich, vegetal, and substantial in portion the dish was anything but light but considering I rarely associate risotto with French cooking I was rather impressed.\n\nPetit Basque Sheep's Cheese with Caramelized Nuts, Apricots, Grilled Bread: Listed only as a cheese plate on the menu this one was a bit of a letdown for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love Petit Basque, especially when nicely aged as this one was - but being in Montreal I couldn't help but hope for a local cheese and while the accoutrements were nice it just wasn't what I'd anticipated at a $6 supplement.\n\nChocolate Profiteroles with sliced almonds:  A second bummer on the dessert menu were the profiteroles ordered by my mother - two small balls of admittedly nice choux pastry encompassing rather bland vanilla ice cream but thankfully topped with dense melted chocolate.  While admittedly not a fan of profiteroles to begin with the almonds were a nice touch, but not enough to save the plate.\n\nValrhona Molten Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream and Pineapple Mango Salsa, Caramel:  Another $6 supplemental dessert this one would actually prove to be worth the time, calories, and money. Beginning first with the cake - sticky, dense, and cooked to the perfect point to maintain the liquid center this oft duplicated dessert poured forth the dense 72% chocolate in plethora and although expectedly bitter the cocoa met an ample foil in the intense vanilla bean ice cream, sweet salsa and caramel, plus brown sugar crumble.\n\nThe Verdict:  In the end I liked La Chronique well enough; the setting is lovely, the service excellent, and the prices fair for the quality (and more so the portions) given, but in comparison to the rest of our dining in  Montreal it was largely unmemorable.  A nice spot to enjoy a leisurely lunch or romantic dinner they certainly have the skills to make a classic French meal - I guess I'd just hoped for more creativity and better desserts given the cost of admission and supplements."], "4": ["Great modern french food with local ingredients.

They rudely asked us to go to a pharmacy to advance some cash even if we told him only debit cards can do cash advance. Ironically, we saw the owner was completely silent about a white guy using his MBNA master card to pay, moreover, he lied on our face by saying he was using his debit ok? We did not ask that white guy to reveal the lie from the owner just for the sake of politeness. We are not blind so please don't fool us.

I don't quite but everything I've had there has been good. There is this salt and pepper crusted fried mushroom that is quite excellent. I also get the vegetarian mushroom ramen soup. Specify that you want the vegetarian broth if you don't want to eat any meat. Ask for some Chinese chilli oil to kick it up a notch. Then there is the Japanese-style veggie tempura rice bowl, which is exactly what it sounds like, a bowl of rice with tempura vegetables on top. If you order this, I suggest that you ask that they forego the onion tempura because it's basically onion rings and for me that's not really worthy tempura material. I want some sweet potato, regular potato, broccoli, asparagus and zucchini when it comes to tempura. Have a pot of tea. They've got quite an extensive selection. They also serve some fascinating sweet dishes as well. Try them if you feel like it. That would make me go from four stars to like four and a half. I always enjoy speaking with the manager, Olivia, about all things Chinese! Now I know a bit more about China and really authentic Chinese food ... which is always welcomed. Mmm congee. She is quite friendly and also amazingly knowledgeable about the ins and outs of the Chinese restaurant industry in Montr\u00e9al. In fact, I wish that she were the owner here.

As a preface, my girlfriend and I didn't actually end up eating very much food there - we actually just chose to leave after our drinks/appetizers and before paying several hundred dollars for what we surmised would be a horrible meal.  So, it is possible that the entrees at Europea are in fact very good, but I doubt it, and even if that is the case, the place is pretty tacky and dingy.  To put the review in context, my girlfriend and I are mid-20s Americans with what I'd call reasonably smart tastes in food and culture - we are not foodies etc., but I'd say we know bad food and a bad restaurant when we see it.\n\nWe booked a reservation here after arranging a last minute trip to Montreal and were looking for a traditionally upscale French dinner to cap off our long weekend in the city.  Europea had great reviews on yelp and opentable, the menu looked good, it is run by a celebrity chef, we were staying a few blocks nearby and appeared to be in a location where you'd find good restaurants, so it seemed like an obvious choice.  Our first concerns emerged as we saw the neighborhood, which is the type of downtown area filled with taco bells, souvenir shops, strip clubs and, of course, tourist trap restaurants.  We decided to google image Europea to see what the inside looked like - judging from the photos online, it appeared to be a tacky restaurant, but we placed some trust in the glowing reviews on yelp and decided to show up for the reservation anyways.  \n\nWe walked in to find the restaurant exactly as portrayed in the images - it looks like it was styled in the early 1990s and hasn't been renovated since.  Picture fake plastic neon colored plants, neon fluorescent lights on the bar, some 90s Euro techno music as light background music, dingy carpets, worn silverware and waiters in ill-fitting tuxedos.  Things didn't look good, but we still gave them the benefit of the doubt, and were seated by the hostess and ordered two martinis.  Our table was next to the staircase in the center of the restaurant and everything on it shook any time someone walked up or down the stairs. \n\nThe martinis came as the host brought out some complementary appetizers: a small dried \"meat strip\" hanging on a tiny clothes hanger, garlic-olive bread sticks, some kind of pesto \"lollipop\" and truffle-cheese popcorn (I think?).  Each food item came with a little story about its preparation.  We took a sip of the martinis, which were gin and vodka respectively...they must have been 50% water, and to boot, were served in metal martini glasses with a comically large stick of olives across the top, so large in fact that we couldn't get the olives in the drink.  We then tried some of the small appetizers and it was impressively bad: the meat strip was glorified beef jerky, the lollipop was horribly according to my gf and the popcorn/breadsticks were not only disgusting, but seemed like they had been left out for several days...just musty, stale and soggy all at once.  The waitress then came by and offered us a hot towel, which she prepared by pouring hot water on a compressed roll of cotton with a teapot, which then expended into a soggy, lukewarm paper towel.\n\nOur waitress then came to the table with a wooden box, opened it and offered us two \"cheese cigars\" (a direct quote)...the cheese cigars were, predictably, your standard microwavable fried mozzarella sticks, but I can't even say they tasted as good as something you might buy in a freezer aisle.  That was the end for us - it's not a cheap restaurant, and we weren't going to risk a few hundred dollars on their food.  So, we got up and left, got a take-out margherita pizza from a place up the street, watched a movie in our apartment and made a toast to not wasting our money on bad food.\n\nLong story short, this place is a tourist trap built to take the money of people that don't know any better.  It is well-reviewed, which I can only presume means that many people on Yelp don't have the most sophisticated of tastes.  But, if you are looking for type of experience described in those reviews, I'd suggest looking in a different neighborhood.  We wish we had booked something in Plateau or one of the other more interesting, cultured neighborhoods.", "Dear Europea,\n\nJudging from the other Yelp reviews, we are in the minority on this one, but we were immune to your charms.\n\nIn the middle of a wonderful stay in Montreal, we were looking forward to dinner with you after an excellent meal at another restaurant in town.\n\nYou tried really, really hard to impress. We know. The whole experience seemed designed to surprise and delight with a parade unexpected wonders. \n\nBut for us, it quickly collapsed into a humorous show that distracted from enjoyment of the food itself.\n\nOur advice? Less is more. A small handful of the below litany of flourishes, if done well, would have been far more enjoyable.\n\nHere are some specific thoughts on our experience.\n\nAMBIANCE\nThere was a lot going on with the interior, which was broken into many smallish rooms and areas. Each table was cluttered with no less than a glossy stone cairn, a rose in a glass and a candle, in addition to the flashy place settings.\n\nAMUSE-BOUCHES, ETC. - the fanfare of surprise bits of food & fun included:\n* Two tiny pieces of dried, flavorless meat hanging inexplicably from a toy clothesline.\n* Truffle popcorn in a black construction paper cone stuck oddly in a bowl of salt along with two goat cheese + crunch somethings in the form of lollipops.\n* The dramatic hot water on the expanding hand & face towlette capsule presented in a miso soup spoon.\n* The lobster cream cappuccino was the exception. It was delicious and easily the best part of the meal. It was flavorful, light and rich all at the same time. Wonderful.\n* A bizarre box in the form of a fake book, filled with smoke and containing a single forgettable salmon h'orderve.\n* A frozen mist of something intended to clean your palate before the main course. Two bowls of it arrived on a platter which also boasted the enchanting bowl of steaming dry ice!\n* After dinner, the overexertion continued with the \"pre-dessert\" featuring:\n        o A metal tree structure festooned with tufts of pink cotton candy and hanging with candy wrapped in cellophane tied to the branches. The base sported macaroons and other things.\n        o Two chocolate-and-something lollipops fixed to the bottom of a stone bowl with edible glue.\n        o A Chinese food container (?) with mini-madeleines and gummy treats.\n        o Cups of custard.\n        o A giant cellophane-wrapped merengue with a Europea sticker.\n\nEvery table was subjected to the exact same stream of gimmicks burped out of the production line, from the postage stamp-size dried meat, to the smoky box, to the cotton candy tree. At one point we smelled the smoke and knew instantly where the other table was in the order of events without even looking - cool! The used smoky boxes sat stacked and sad-looking on a side table. The cotton candy trees waited impatiently next to them in rows, ready to be served.\n\nENTREE\nI ordered the Cornish hen prepared in a clay pot. I expected an entire fist-size bird with delicious flavor and nicely browned skin. My Cornish hen arrived at the table sealed in its clay pot on a silver platter. I was then given the \"honor\" of breaking the clay pot with my very own hammer! Silly. They then took the broken pieces back to the kitchen and reemerged with the prepared plate containing two pale pieces (breasts?) of meat on a bed of potato puree, vegetables, etc. The pieces seemed too large for a Cornish hen and the flavor was bland and forgettable.\n\nMy dinner partner ordered the red risotto with shrimp and beets. In hindsight, the name of the dish gave us fair warning, but we weren't expecting a bloody red mass on the plate. It was tastier than the Cornish hen but disturbing to have THAT much red glaring at you.\n\nAfter the red scare and the \"pre-dessert\", we skipped actual dessert and went home disappointed.", "The worst restaurant I've ever been in Montreal. Upon arrival, the valet asked me if I'm Uber driver waiting for someone to pick up. Things went wrong from the start.\n\nI had to plead with the server to explain the menu and to order drink. The server took my bottle of champagne away from my reach and I had to signal for each refill - very uncomfortable. This is enough about the service - the worst. The service is bad for a reason. Serving each table is a logistics nightmare since everything they do is unpractical.\n\nThe food is bland and nothing exceptional about it. I ordered the complete testing menu ( not short one) to gain full experience. What a waste of money.\n\nThe ambiance is stuffy and the two guys sitting next to me were so pretentious. I'm sure they have small dick.\n\nAll in all this place is for losers who want to make themselves feel important. But in reality they are nothing. \n\nBeing clean - they bring me foods in ancient book cases that cannot be cleaned. I question the practicality of this establishment. However the chef is able to fool enough people to stay in business. \n\nIn conclusion - I prefer not to go back again unless for some unforeseen reason. I advise for others to stay away unless to quench curious desire. \n\nI'm done visiting restaurants like this. Toque fooled \nme once and now this. I'll never be fooled again.\n\n\"The David Copperfield of Restaurants\"\n\nThis is a place to witness the worst of humanity. People taking advantage of the poor and institutional corruption."], "2": ["This was probably the biggest waste of money.  We got the table d'hote which was 60 bucks per person.  A lot of filler courses for pizzazz that just wasnt impressive, really a lot of fluff.  Started off with the lobster cappucino, which was good once you got passed the cream part.  The appetizer were parmesan crisps with goat cheese.  For appetizers we had the crab declination which was a trio of crab (not good, so bland), got the seared foie gras in which we really enjoyed the morel mushroom emulsion.  The highlight of the meal was definitely our entree.  If we had ordered only the entree we would have rated the meal higher.  We had the filet of halibut, cooked perfectly over creamy mashed potatoes, with a tomato \"ketchup\".  The veal cheeks were great! They were cooked perfectly, and were very flavorful.  Dessert was weird.  It was like a strawberry parfait, different, but not good with madelines.  They also brought out some petit fours consisting of passion fruit marshmellow, pistachio macarons and peach, and chocolate lollipop?  They gave us a nice parting gift of meringue cookies with nuts (although they tasted a little stale).", "Eurpea was recomended from our hotel.  However, If you are hungry do not bother coming to this place.  \n\nStarting on a bad note...Our table was updatirs near the spiral staircase and shook everytime the waiters and patrons went up and down the stairs.  That was very distracting.\n\nThe portions were small, in fact the chef contantly sends out free apps, like the lobster bisque in a espresso cup  Other free apps were cheese cigars, similar to a mozarella stick, tempura cauliflower, mini olive muffin and a small sampling of  deserts.\n\nHowever, the real misconception was the hen I ordered was shown in the roating pot tableside  and was brought back to the kitchen and presented back to me with only 2 oz of meat.  For the price of $34, I should get 1/4 bird.\n\nI also agree with other reviews the wine pours are skimpy as well.\n\nThe food presenations was pretty cool, but I would rather have bigger portions.   \n\nI would not go back again.\n\nTry DNA aor other guide book recomendations,", "Presentation was fantastic, food was very good. However, the service was surprisingly poor and the wine pairing for the tasting was not impressive. Overall, a disappointing experience."], "3": ["My boyfriend and I went to Europea for our 2010 New Year's dinner. I had Googled options for a few days and it seemed like a good choice to spend the countdown at. There was a special NYE tasting menu which we of course had... ok so I lied, I wanted the tasting menu haha. Some dishes were great while some were very very bad. There was one I couldn't take another bite of because it made me (us) want to throw up. Graphic, I know... but I don't think it was the restaurant's fault. The dish had a particular cheese in it that was just so overbearing and it offended my mouth!! and I love cheese! So that was weird. The service was overattentive which is always a good thing when you are wanting a romantic evening with your squeeze for a holiday. For the money and the inconsistency of the food, I don't think I will be going back again if I'm in Montreal.... Piet de Cochon will always win my vote...but it is a beautiful restaurant. Try it and form your opinion on the place? I honestly think your experience could go either way!", "This is a pretty good restaurant, but I disagree with all the raving reviews.  I see the words creative, refined and sofisticated coming from my fellow reviewers.  I disagree.  I had the prix fix menu and I can't say I was impressed with any of the 8 or 9 dishes.  They are all good.  Just good.  I just spent the week eating at places like l'Epicier, Milos and Au Pied du Cuchon and this place just couldn't comparre.  I was bored. The service was not very good at all.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but the attitude was just not right.  If I'm paying $300 for dinner, I don't need a waitress who's snobby.  I was ordering 18 year Yamazaki and every time she brought one out, it was smaller than the last.  I mean, 2 sips maybe.  I've never gone anywhere where they serve such embarrassing drink portions.  Man, raise the price and serve a decent amount.  I didn't want to complain so finally I just said, \"do me a favor, please take this back and tell the bartender to serve me a double because I'm not used to seeing a glass served with such little alcohol.\" This girl tells me, no, drink that and then I'll get you anotherone.  Are you kidding me?  This was just one of the things.  She had an attitude and frankly, I go pay big money to dine at these kinds of restaurants because I want to be treated like a king while I dine like a king.  \n\nAs for the food, each dish was ok.  I did not think they were imaginative at all.  Like I said, absolutely nothing memorable.  Nothing I haven't had before.  When comparing it to the other restaurants we dined at in Montreal, I would say that this was easily the worst one.  The ambience was nice and the presentation was very good, but it just came up short in the service and food, which is why I go to a place like this in the first place.", "I was really looking forward to this meal with all the awesome reviews.  I visited this restaurant for the last supper of a 3 day weekend trip to Montreal. I was very disappointed. \n\nFirst, the restaurant has a weird design.  The kitchen is in the basement, seating is available on the 1st and 2nd floor, and the bar is on the 2nd floor. I feel bad for the waiters there.  They had to walk up and down carrying the food and drinks.\n\nWe had 2 discovery tasting menus with different selections so we can try everything.  They started us off with a lobster bisque, which was good but would of enjoyed more lobster bits in the \"shot\" of soup. Appetizers, we had the tomatoes with mozarella and crab salad.  The tomatoes were very sweet and served on top of a syrup glazed wafer-like thing, which made it even sweeter! I think I would of enjoyed it more with a savory cracker base instead.  The crab salad had non-existent crab.  Although the presentation was fancy, I was not impressed.  Thank god we ordered an extra appetizer, Bison tartare, which was the only fantastic dish. Entree, we had the mushroom ravioli which was very heavy and served on a big bowl, which made it hard to cut up and eat.  (They were huge pieces of ravioli, not bite-sized.)  Also, had the veal served with some potato puree, not impressed.  They finished the meal off with a bunch of sweets/cookies, icecream lollipop thing, a huge fluff of cotton candy, and more cookies to take home.  Sugar overload!\n\nI think they try really hard to make it creative and fun dining experience.  But for me, I care more about the food over the presentation.  The service was okay, they forgot our tea and coffee (had to remind them) and they did not offer ground pepper for our raviolis.  This was the most expensive meal we had during our trip and it was the most disappointing.  There are plenty of other nice restaurants to go to which will definitely give you a better \"food\" experience. (Toque! was excellent and so was Au Pied de Cochon)"], "4": ["It can be a challenge finding a good place to eat on a Monday night, since so many fine dining restaurants are closed. We had hoped to try Toqu\u00e9! but they were closed both nights we were in town. Europea was open and we were able to get reservations, so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant has an elegant interior, and the night we were there it was mostly a business crowd, so we felt slightly underdressed. We both got the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. The menu is inspired by Qu\u00e9bec's fresh produce. Presentation was excellent on all of the dishes; if I hadn't been to a place like this before I would have been more impressed, but we were a little underwhelmed as we've had better in LA (most recently at Gordon Ramsay), especially for the price. But it was still very good. As best as I can remember, our courses were as follows:\n\nAmuse bouche: goat cheese mousse with risotto and bacon\nLobster cream cappuccino with truffle oil\nPrincess scallops, prepared in the shell with morel mushroom milk, sea water emulsion, parsnip pur\u00e9e\nDuo of pan seared and torchon foie gras\nLight C02 foam prepared with C\u00e9sar salad\nSurf & turf (medallion of milk fed veal with a crust of herbs pesto, langoustine ravioli with confit tomatoes, saut\u00e9ed girolles mushrooms\nCheese plate\n2 dessert courses\n\nThe desserts were extremely elaborate. Our first dessert course included panna cotta and a huge 3-tiered tray of bite-sized desserts, including maple marshmallow, chocolate-covered orange rind, chocolate-covered strawberries, apricot jelly pistachio tart, etc. Our second dessert course included a chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me with espresso foam and butterscotch ice cream.\n\nProbably my favorite dishes were the scallops and the langoustines, and my least favorite was the veal, which was slightly overcooked for our more bloody tastes. Foam was used in several dishes (it is molecular gastronomy after all), which may be a little gimmicky but I'm not complaining - actually the caesar salad foam dish was fairly interesting, and the foam that came with the scallops was an excellent complement. For our cheese course a large table of cheeses was brought out, from which we got to choose 4, so we chose all of the local Qu\u00e9bec cheeses that they offered. The wine pairings were somewhat uninspired in our opinion, but we did enjoy the Barolo that was served with our surf & turf course, and I appreciated that they served a local Canadian sweet wine with the foie gras course rather than the traditional Sauternes. There were only 4 wines served with the 9 courses, which on the one hand comes across as not enough, but on the other hand it was nice to still be fairly sober at the end of the meal.  \n\nPersonally I don't need to go back anytime soon, but it was a good dinner overall, and it seemed like a good place for a business dinner or a date if you've got money to spend.", "amazing execution. Nice and creative recipe. nice atmosphere. Service a bit too relaxed for the place but I guess is the the Quebec way.... Make it a stop when you are in Montreal, you wont regret it.", "Amazing menu, amazing service and great food.  I recently went to Europea and entertained a bunch of clients in the semi private room, there were 16 of us in total.  Although we were all english speaking, I found everyone very helpful and the service was tip top.  All of the dishes we ordered were wonderful and a number of my clients remarked upon the fact that this was one of the best restaurant they had visited recently and  would certainly be bringing some of their clients here.\n\nOnly reason I didnt give them five stars was that my entree of deer, was slightly over cooked.  When I remarked to other diners they all said that there dish was perfectly prepared, so I think I was just unfortunate.  I would defintely return when I next visit Montreal and would recommend to anyone."], "5": ["i think everyone can recall specific detail of many momentary tastes they had experienced in their first truly exquisite meal. it may not be their favorite meal, or their choice of hypothetical last meal (as this often returns to something your mother made), but it is etched in each person's memory as the moment where they spent more than they ever had before, and walked away with a memory an experience, and a justification as to the value of fine flavor in a world of economic woes. \neuropea is that first fine meal for me. i and my then boyfriend, and now husband, had spontaneously driven the hours and hours up to canada one year for an international film festival, and as we had been experimenting with several cooking techniques, we decided to splurge, and really try to find out what food cooked by someone with classical french cooking skill tastes like. the person at the hotel desk recommended europea, which was located only a few blocks away.\nwe decided on the tasting menu, with wine pairings, which was a tremendous amount of money in that we had both just started \"grown up\" jobs. but it was completely worth it, and again and again, this restaurant remains my benchmark in an experience of a meal that was completely worth the amount of money we had paid.\ni can't recall the exact order or items of the menu. but i will tell you that i still recall the taste of the amuse bouche as if it were ten minutes ago. a tiny spoon, and a little espresso cup, filled with the finest, richest taste of lobster cappuchino, or bisque, that you could ever imagine. it sent both of us into a closed eye making of a memory. other dishes that followed included my first taste of foie gras, which was seared and served with a fruit based sauce. of course, the meal continued on with wines, meats, cheeses, and delightful deserts, ending with the finest cup of coffee i've ever closed a meal with. we both left, slightly tipsy, and with the feeling that we would value food as an art for the rest of our lives. each dish cooked once, for one patron, and is different each subsequent time it is cooked due to variations in cooking time or seasons. i felt truly lucky after this meal. \ni wish i could recite to you the sequence of dishes, but honestly i wasn't of the initiated at the time that i had eaten here. what i would recommend is that if you're in montreal and in need for a real treat, but have never had an extensive tasting menu before, take the plunge and try this restaurant which will set your standards for you. i truly enjoyed it, and have gone on to taste the creations of the likes of pierre garnaire (paris), david chang (new york), the chefs at les ambassadeurs (paris), my boy ken oringer (boston), etc etc. europea still remains amongst the best and of course my virgin tasting menu. and as a result, fine food is now draining my expenses day after day, but without regret:)", "Except 200-220$ (tip included) for the \n\nPrevious Commentary by Christopher M.,  but I must add some notes. First of all the French Toast with Foie Gras and berry with reduces Chicoutai was Extraordinary. I think I'd have that everyday. The Princess scallops with porcini cream was really good: The texture - almost crispy-ish of the scalopp with the creamy taste was a nice blend in mouth .It is some New French Cuisine with some extreme talent. As for the Service, I'm French I know it was relaxed and absolutely professional and since there as no english-speaker client around our table, I must say that I don't know if they might be a language barriage of not.  The Service was fast and you could feel the kitchen staff was drilled and professionnal; The talent was constant. I took the Menu Degustation Signature\" with the accompanying wine pairing (5 glasses of wine) (too)).  Wine were approx. some 20-50$ wine so somehow some decent quality wine. \n\nAs for the CO2 ceasar salad, it is presented as an experience therefore I could not agree on the taste. Personally I thought i was special but not in the bad way. Good mixed taste with the Parmeggiano but I would have found the taste a little bit more fun if the porcetta was cut in small bites and pour into the \u00abSalad Mousse\u00bb. \n\nAll the portion were really by the book of French Cuisine standard full 7 courses meal ; approx from 40 to 100g per course (2 to 4 onces) and the main course was 150g (4.5-5 onces). The Cheese course was really well presented and all cheesed were tempered so the flavours were enhanced and tastier. As an ex-cheese-seller I can definately assure you the selection is good. \nThe presentation and the freshness and taste of desert were incredible. \n\nAgain, another point where I would disagree with the previous post is the price which is justifiable because you have some extremly high quality products that are fresh and  as an Ex-Chef I can tell that the cost of the products that are served in your dishes easiely cost 30$- 40$. So basically if you go there and have some training in the food business, trust me, you'll be AMAZED by the technics they're employing for the menu. I think the same Restaurant in New York City would cost approximatively 300-400$ per person. Such products are really hard to find and not foundable in a near area.", "I love Euproea. If you treat dinning as an experience as opposed to just good food, you will love it too. I was surprised and delighted for all the gifts from the chef. It was fun and creative.

We were also served an amuse bouche, delicious paste with pita bread chips, unfortunately the chips was burned, I'm not sure why would you serve it at all, just make a new one, basic quality control. I had a craving for carbonara, so I ended up with a big portion of pasta. There is someone who makes wonderful carbonara for me at his home and I have to say the Machiavelli version is pretty good too.

While their nachos are the best I've ever had (seriously, I dream about them), it is easy to rack up quite a tab as their pints are slightly more expensive than average.

Really? Is that all you can make? It was very bland and felt like they just threw in something in a bowl real quick in the middle of making the \"real food\" for others. I could have easily made a better salad at home and I never even cook.\n\nThen, for the main meal, they brought the mains for everyone else and left me waiting 10 minutes for mine. They had forgotten about me. So they threw something else together real quick once again. What I got was a really weird combination of yet another salad and a side of lentil.... salad.\n\nNeedless to say I left Venti with a very unsatisfied feeling that I had just gotten ripped off. The food was extremely lackluster and I never felt like I was eating in an italian restaurant.\n\nHow about putting some thought into what you serve vegetarians? Italian food has so many great options for people who do not eat meat!! I suggest taking a stroll to DNA to know how to use your regional ingredients better and for a slew of creative and satisfying vegetarian dishes.\n\nAnother strike for Venti.. the noise level is completely unbearable.

I am not sure what they could do to help this, but it's just not an environment conducive to any sort of social interaction...\n\nOn top of all this, the service was very subpar. I had to ask 3 different waiters to bring me lemon for my water before I finally got it.

I ordered the Piadina panini and my boyfriend ordered the asparagi milanese and gnocchi di ricotta. My bf's dishes were incredibly delicious . . .very light and flavorful. My panini was not very good and I didn't care to finish. It was very salty and dry - not a good combination. I gave Venti three stars because I thought the lunch menu was expensive. The pasta, for $15, was not very big and the salad was 3 spears of asparagus and a fried egg for $10. Also, the service did not do the restaurant justice. Our waiter seemed to be just going through the motions. The lunch menu says \"dinner menu also available\", so we asked for it and made our original selections from that menu. When we ordered, the waiter said we could not order from the dinner menu. very odd . . . why did he give us the dinner menu then? I believe we were the only patrons there during lunch hour.

They run lunch like they would an evening meal where you have more time to spend eating with friends.\n\nThe bigest issue with this place is the noise! The acoustics in this place are horrible, as soon as there are then 10 people in the restaurant and you won't be able to hear the person sitting across the table from you.

But, that said, the menu looks great, they're one of the only restaurants in Montreal with a pasta extruder (meaning they can make dried pasta in a range of finicky shapes [like strozzapreti!], in addition to making fresh pasta), and they appear to have a strong team in the kitchen (two of the featured pasta dishes that night--artichokes, sweetbreads, mint, and tagliatelle & strozzapreti with lamb sausage and mustard greens--were perfectly executed and rank among the best I've had anywhere).", "Planning an evening out with a group of boisterous friends, lively conversation, good food, and a few glasses of vino, and not too worried about having to wait between courses because you'll be busy chatting it up anyway?

The first time, it wasn't too long after they opened, and although the food was wonderful (the melt-in-your-mouth gnocchi de ricotta was the best gnocchi I've ever had), the service was a little off. The food warranted a second try though, and this time I had a fabulous evening (and better service) with a group of friends. We laughed, ate, and drank all night long. \n\nThe cod crostini was the perfect mix of creamy and salty, and the cornish hen was full of flavour. My boyfriend raved about the veal meatballs. The only thing I would skip if I returned is the arugula salad (I've had better). \n\nThe menu is divided into many courses: crostinis, antipasti, primi, secondi, sides, and of course dessert. The mains (secondi) don't come with any sides, so order a side dish if you want some veggies. For big groups, it's worth considering the timing of the courses, since it's unlikely that anyone will order each course. Ordering a bunch of dishes and sharing is a good way to go. \n\nVenti also has a great Italian wine list: we had a lovely, crisp Prosecco to start the night, and a juicy Amarone with our mains.", "Normally when I travel for work my meals consist of Sonic and Subway.

I had the heirloom tomato salad and beet ravioli.  The salad was good but it had large chunks of salt that made it jarringly salty.  The beet ravioli was so fantastic!  I loved everything about it.  I'm hoping to either A) find the recipe online, B) track down the chef and beg him for the recipe, or C) go back to Venti on my next Montreal plant trial.  I will be doing C for sure.  I loved the open kitchen and the racks of wine and jarred ingredients around the area.  This was a great place to eat.  The service was so-so but we sat at the bar and it was pretty busy.

This was quite a treat and an excellent way to start the meal. Perfectly smooth texture with a wonderfully strong chocolate taste that just screams out \"we melted down actually chocolate for this\". The hazelnut note was less than normal Nutella but still very present. Very well done.\n\nNext up, we ordered a side of the Ricotta fritters. They came in 3 varieties - fennel, coriander and a third one which I forgot actually. All three were quite good although I really didn't pick up any hint of coriander in that one.

When even the waitress notes picking up the plates that most people don't finish it, you know you are dealing with a big dish. The dish works pretty well - the combination of the poached egg, the creme fraiche and cheese with the actual potato creates a nice richness and creaminess. The smoked bacon adds a little crunch and the salsa verde, while not as spicy as it was implied by our waitress, added a very nice kick to the dish. Definitely something I never would have expected for brunch.\n\nOn my end, I ordered the sausage roll with spicy red cabbage and mint compote. The roll was a large whole sausage with caramelized onions wrapped in puff pastry. Very good although I must admit that I had expected the interior to be a sausage and onion filling. Because the sausage was whole, as soon as you cut it, the pastry just fell off the sausage. A pretty minor issue in reality. The red cabbage added some texture and bite to the dish all while giving that little hint of spice. The mint compote was nice and light - the perfect way to cleanse the palette as you went about your meal.\n\nThis was a very nice experience from beginning to end. The service was friendly and attentive all while being timely. The variety of the menu is a nice plus for them - very creative options for people who want something else out of their brunch. I truly looked forward to coming back at some point for their dinner service.\n\nCheers!", "Servers are friendly and attentive. Food was good-very good......the heirloom toamato salad starter was excellent as was the pasta&squid starter, stuffed quail main course was very good, veal dish not so much.....Banoffi pie dessert was very very good.\nDecor is minimalist and boring,seats are comfy, tables look like cheap cafeteria tables. My biggest complaint was the amount of tie this meal took.....I'm sure they are intentionally dragging the service out to keep the place looking busy....and as good as the food was...it wasn't good enough for a two and a half hour meal.

Ma blonde a pris un cocktail maison tr\u00e8s bon, c'\u00e9tait avec de la pur\u00e9e de framboises et du basilic avec du gin.\n\nLe restaurant met l'emphase sur la provenant des aliments.

C'\u00e9tait une limonade maison congel\u00e9 pour faire comme un popsicle avec un peu de poudre de limette qui p\u00e9tille dans la bouche. C'est comme des bonbons, mais avant le repas principal. C'\u00e9tait bien plaisant.\n\nVenait ensuit le plat de r\u00e9sistance. J'ai pris le steak.

Je m'attendais \u00e0 dequoi de relativement meilleur pour une plat \u00e0 29$, mais je pense que j'avais de tr\u00e8s hautes attentes.  Ma blonde a pris le francobolli et WOW. C'est un genre de ravioli avec du fromage ricotta \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur, mais avec un ext\u00e9rieur diff\u00e9rent que de la p\u00e2te.

The place is very modern and well decorated, with a very nice bar; this is definitely your typical St-Laurent Supper Club. The food however, leaves much to be desired.\n\nWe all ordered appetizers, and I believe the only decent appetizer were the Tuna Bombs. Nearly all of us ordered a pasta for our main course. With about 5 or 6 different pastas to sample at the table, they were all actually terrible. So bland and tasteless, it was almost like eating cardboard. Not to mention that some people's noodles were overcooked. It was a few forkfulls into the Penne Arrabiata when one of my friends discovered some hard, wood-like foreign element in her pasta. This piece of wood was disovered after biting into it. My very favorite though, was sampling the veal ravioli - I swear I thought I was eating dog food!\n\nWith the evening going so horribly wrong, I had been drinking vodka for most of the evening, and when I decided to switch to white wine, I ordered a bottle and it ended up being served to me at room temperature. We complained to the manager about the quality of the food, and the piss-temperature wine, and all he had to say was, \"That's what the ice bucket is for. The wine came out of our refrigerated wine cellar.\" Well, somebody clearly forgot to plug in the damn refrigeration unit! He offered to replace our meals, but we all agreed that the food was terrible, and did not want to sample anything further.\n\nWe spoke to some other people who had dined there that night, and they said their food was fine. None of them ordered pasta though, so who knows, maybe some of the food is half-decent, but seriously, if you call your restaurant Macaroni Bar, I would expect you to be able to boil some noodles properly and whip up a half-decent sauce!", "I went there with 10 people to celebrate my big 3. Food was good. Nothing sensational but good. Waiters were great. Amazing service for dinner.\n\nAround midnight, another 15 people came to join us. Bouncer made them wait way too long, about 45 minutes and the place was half empty... so they just left. Instead, he would let other people go in right in front of their eyes.  Go figure: the place offers valet services and is filled with skanky girls. We heard it was a classy place but i would say it looked more as a cracked house with all those yukky girls... So they lost a lot of sales that night because we were planning to really enjoy ourselves. Very disappointed, and they litteraly ruined my birthday.

Not worth it."], "2": ["I have been to Macaroni Bar before, and if memory serves me correctly (because this is going back a few years), I had had the gnocchi, which was pretty darn good. So, with this preconception in mind, I was excited to be going back for the gnocchi. This was an extension of the previously posted bachelorette party, so we had worked up quite an appetite while pole dancing. We had reservations for the 9pm dinner seating, and were promised we would be able to keep our table once it turned into the club afterwards. We had arrived in two groups, and apparently there had been a mix-up in our seatings, and were offered a round of shots to compensate for the mishap. I was pretty bummed I couldn't partake in the free shots (because who doesn't love free shots!), but happily sent it over to the bride-to-be. When we were seated at our proper table, the waitress came around to take our drink orders, but I was left out, and had to wait an additional 20 minutes before I could order my diet virgin Cuba Libr\u00e9 (yes, you read that right - it's my fancy way of ordering a diet coke with lime). They brought out this garlic cornbread-esque basket for the table, but didn't seem to provide enough to go around. We each got a very small piece, but what can you do. Looking at the menu, I was saddened to see that the gnocchi I had enjoyed the last time I had been there was nowhere to be seen! Being a huge fan of mac'n'cheese, that was my second choice, but I couldn't justify spending 25$ on mac'n'cheese. After toying with the idea of getting the grilled chicken salad, I finally broke down and ordered the 25$ mac'n'cheese. I figured it would be a decent-sized portion for the price. It took about 45 minutes before we even got our food, and seeing as how they took almost 45 minutes to actually take our orders, we were pretty starving by this point. When I got my order, I was left wanting more. I got a very small cast-iron skillet with mac'n'cheese, that I probably could've finished in 5 bites, had I not taken my time and eaten one rigatoni at a time. The dish itself was decent, but definitely NOT worth the 15$ price-tag; I make mac'n'cheese at home often enough, and what I make is equal or even superior to what I had here. Suffice to say, I was still pretty hungry afterwards. I could've ordered dessert, but I didn't feel it right to hand over even more of my money for what probably would have been a bite-size 10$ plate. Going around the table, my fellow party guests were equally as unimpressed with the fare as I was; it was good, but nothing to write home about. And not worth coming back for, especially at the ridiculous prices. \n\nAs for the dancing afterwards, it was a good time. I wasn't aware of this, but it was a throwback Saturday; they played dance and r&b hits from the 90s and made for a great time. The one downside was the spacing; we didn't have much of it. All in all though, a good night."], "3": ["First of all, Macaroni is trying to cultivate an image - a supper club where image comes first (more on that later), and food is an afterthought. \n\nThat being said, their objectives fail on both accounts - the food is actually much  better than you would think and the image they're trying to create falls totally flat. Classic. \n\nIn any case, I'll start with the ambience. It's fairly open and the decor is based on black/white contrasting color schemes. When the lights dim, it looks pretty good, albeit a bit plasticky, which may or may not be the point. To the side of the place, there's a large terrace, which is really nice in the summer. The service itself is hit or miss. Depends totally on who's waitressing that night, how good of a mood everyone's in, and how busy it is. Wild swings in service quality is the hallmark of a waitstaff that's hired for looks over experience, and it shows at Macaroni.\n\nThe food is standard 2009-2011 Montreal copycat bistro fare. I can't even remember what's on the menu, but I bet I'm probably dead-on if I randomly guess braised-lamb ravioli, lobster taco or maybe lobster rolls, probably a macaroni-cheese dish with a twist (like a thin layer of foie gras on it), etc...etc... The food is fairly well done (suprisingly) and the presentation is excellent. I've never had a poorly done dish there - in fact, I would say they're as good as any quality Plateau resto that does nothing but pride themselves on their chef and the food.\n\nUnfortunately, as others have mentioned, the scene they're desperately trying to create ranges from casual and acceptable to outright idiotic. I've seen lineups nearly going around to block to get in on weekends, and the bouncer is tragically bad at picking quality patrons. The girls range from barely legal scene-whores that have to pool everyone's allowance to buy a bottle, to ageing cougars stuffing their flabby bodies in Betsy Johnson dresses, desperately clinging to whatever semblance of youth they have left. As for the guys, forget it - fauxhawks galore, externally stitched dress shirts with double-button cuffs, jeans with patterns on them, TW Steel watches - a total mess.\n\nYou know what? This review seems harsh, but I actually kind of like the place. \n\nYour best bet, if you're looking to actually eat, is to go on a weeknight (like Monday or Tuesday)  and enjoy the excellent food. Skip the weekend."], "4": ["We went for drinks and dinner on a Thursday evening. The staff were very helpful and the food was excellent. Innovative appetizers and very large portions for the entrees.", "I don't understand why people don't like this place other than attitude - what do you expect for a place trying to be a swanky hip place?  First time I ate there, a girlfriend and I walked in without a reservation.  After an eye-roll from the hostesses (all wearing an interesting 6\" heel and mini skirt not really attired to service any food), they found us a small table giving us a 3 hour time window to finish.  I guess you better be prepared to expect people taking this restaurant and making it a \"to be seen\" night scene.  \nThe hostesses try to act a little snotty about reservations, but once you get over the initial scene, things only got better.\n\nThe waiter made up for the non-polite hostess.  Our waiter smiled the entire time and made sure to service our every need in a timely fashion.  He was so excited about the dishes, had tried a majority of them, and gave great advice.  I LOVED loved the gnocchi poutine - something unusual for a Montrealer having tried every fry variety of the dish.  The gnocchi oozed as if a crunchy ball of melty cheese instead of a dumpling.  And the sauce is not your average gravy.  Besides the appetizer, the other dishes were good too - nothing out of this world, but great tasting and satisfying.  And unlike a lot of places, the serving size was ample for most dinner plates and had great presentations.  I don't know if maybe there's variability in the service, but both times I ate there, I had a great time.  I would for sure go back there and hopefully you enjoy it just as much!", "Tagliatone con funghi was superb, as was the S'mores dessert. Service attentive and friendly during dinner on the patio. Be forewarned: this place is Bachelorette Party Central.\n\nThe restaurant gets very crowded after dinner (basically, it turns into a club), at which point servers attending to bottle service patrons become aggressive and pushy as they maneuver through the thick crowd. We get it - you have to do your job, but we didn't come to get shoved around either. I guess that's why everyone ends up dancing on the tables, to avoid the mosh-pit. \n\nThe outdoor patio had a more casual-yet-trendy vibe, but noise by-laws mean the music can't be played on the patio after a certain hour."]}}, "0lP8Y9-51l7LydplYtDfBg": {"reviews": {"1": ["Worst service and meal I've had in a long time.

But I know French food is not generally vegetarian friendly, so searched for one that was and chose this one for that reason and because folks seem to love it. But I didn't. \n\nI started with a tomato salad, the only non-meat appetizer of any sort. It was pretty good, especially the herbs sprinkled throughout, but they served it on a small cutting board for some reason, which was just plain stupid. I had to try extra hard not to have it fall into my lap or get balsamic vinegar everywhere.\n\nThere were three vegetarian entrees -- a pasta, a vegetable plate, and a tomato tart. The tart sounded most interesting and French, so I ordered that. It took forever to come and when it did it looked like some poorly executed \"artisinal\" pizza you'd get at a mall Italian restaurant trying to go uptown. It tasted better than that, but not by much. It wasn't a tart as I'd define one. It was a piece of poorly done crust, with some tomatoes and cheese, and a few greens, thrown on top, and probably put in the broiler for a minute.\n\nShortly before my tart came, the restaurant sat another couple right beside me with only about a foot separating our tables even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It made the rest of the night uncomfortable for me as a solo diner. I doubt the couple liked it either. When I finished my meal, I asked for my check, waited forever, read about 20 pages of a book without anyone paying any attention to me, and then had to flag someone down to ask again.\n\nThe music -- early Stones and T-Rex -- was the best part of the restaurant, which is pretty sad."], "3": ["Very ordinary. Very. Very. Very. Blackboard and chalk. Over priced wine. Plain French food. Try something else if you're trying to impress someone. If you go here... You might not get a second date;)", "My girlfriend and I went to La Salle because she wanted \"French Cuisine\" and with all the raving reviews, I decided to take her here. A lot of people say that reservations is a must, therefore we called and placed a reservation. We thought we were making a reservation for a table (the person on the phone didn't really speak fluent English), but when we got there, it was actually a reservation for 2 seats at the bar since the whole place was booked. While we're already there, we might as well try it out.\n\nAfter being seated at the bar, we were given a menu and my girlfriend decide to go with the pork chops and I decided to go for the rabbit leg (a.k.a. Plat) since a lot of Yelpers say it's amazing. As for appetizer, we ordered the Foie Gras. After about 15 minutes, we were offered bread, and I don't know if it was because I was hungry, but damn, those bread with butter were darn good.\n\nAnyways, even after 10 minutes of waiting, our server did not come and take our order. We waited and waited...after another 5 minutes, our server finally came and took our order. The appetizer came 10 minutes after we ordered, it looked like a piece of steak on top of bread. When we dug our fork in, boy was I wrong. The texture of the Foie Gras (Pork/duck liver) was like jello, or some kind of gelatinous piece of meat. I took my first bite, and it was okay, the taste was creamy and gamey. My girlfriend didn't like it much and I probably won't order it again.\n\nThe entrees arrived probably 15 minutes after we finished our appetizer. The rabbit leg was smaller than I expected, but boy was it good with the bacon and mash potatoes! If you order this dish, definitely take a bit of rabbit, bacon and mash potato and eat it all at once...it's like an explosion in your mouth with the sauce! Although, I must say that if I was blindfolded and given a taste test of rabbit's leg and chicken, I probably won't be able to tell the difference.\n\nI also tried a bit of my girlfriend's pork chop, it had great taste and texture!\n\nAfter finishing our entree, we had to wait a long long time for someone to take away our plates and even longer to get our check! We waited probably a good 20 minutes before the owner (I think) came over and asked us how our dinner was and went to the server and told him to give us our check. \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good and I would come back and try other entrees. The Foie Gras is definitely a love or hate thing, for me, the texture was a turn off. As for the service, I know it was busy, but I hate it when restaurants treat me unequally, mostly because I look like a kid. I can't really blame them, because A LOT of restaurants treat me this way. But, I must say, I have to deduct a point because of the horrible service. If you want to come here, definitely make a reservation a day in advance or so. The food is definitely a bit pricey, don't expect to drop down anything less than 50$ for 2 people.", "I was there with my husband and a friend about two weeks ago, we heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to try it out.\nWhen we got there, the restaurant seemed very casual, very Montreal style! We were sat down right away but were left by ourselves for at least 30-40 minutes without water or menu. When we were finally asked for what we wanted to drink, the waitress took 30 more minutes to bring us 2 beers and 1 soda. \nSome of the dishes on the menu were pretty good but some tasted really weird. I ordered the steamed asian style horse bun, the bun was under cooked and they put way too much sweet sauce. I asked the waitress if the bun was suppose to be gooey and wet (think about when you just mixed flour and water together to create a dough without cooking the dough), the waitress told me that's how they make it, the dough is streamed and it's not suppose to be solid (very disappointing). Finally, it we ordered a tartelette to share for dessert, it took them 45 minutes to serve us the dessert and the tartelette was SUPER sour.\nOur favourite dish was an appetizer dish that our friend ordered \"Tempura style zucchini flower\" and the \"Salmon Tartar.\" \nI'm giving Salle a Manger only 3 stars because the service was really bad and the food was just so so with some interesting dishes on the menu."], "4": ["a friend took me here because she heard through friends that it was good.\n\nit is good.\n\nthe deer carpaccio is amazing, fresh meat well accompanied with a special mayo sauce and balsamic vinegar, and fried onions sprinkled on top, nice very nice.\n\nthe mackerel is nice too, surprisingly, i usually don't like mackerel cuz it's smelly, but this dish has bacon bits in it and the sauce has honey  i think so the sweetness adds a nice touch.\n\nThe gnocchi is so very good, just as good as Il Mulino, and that's as good as it gets. It's made fresh, it's soft and just melts in your mouth, the sauce is a bit creamy but not rich, but smooth and well balanced. With a touch of parmesan and crushed pepper and suddenly the last bite is up and you wondered how you inhaled the whole thing so quickly...\n\nThe seared foie gras with balsamic vinegar was nice too. But we're in montreal and foie gras is done well everywhere... this one was good but it doesn't stand out that's all, but it was very good.\n\nAt first glance this place reminds me of au pied de cochon, open kitchen eating bar concept. the ambiance is similar But the food is different.\n\nall in all this is was a wonderful surprise, on the strength of the mackerel, carpaccio and gnocchi. the price is decent about 130$ tax tips included for two, two entr\u00e9es, two main dishes, two desserts and one glass of wine.\n\nThis and Kazu, are my new favorite restaurants of 2010", "Dinner at Salle a Manger was the only thing capable of distracting me from my sexy date.

Thank you for a lovely dinner Salle a Manger!", "The poor bunny never had a chance.\n\nHe must have innocently popped his head up from his hole at precisely the wrong moment.   The blunt force of the bullet or poison dart or whatever they used must have instantly rendered him unconscious and quickly drained the life from his furry white body.\n\nGod only knows how the couriers-de-bois managed to sweep his lifeless carcass from the woods of the townships to the heart of the plateau with furious speed and medical accuracy.    I think that the body was still deliciously warm when he arrived on our stunning table.\n\nHe arrived de-furred and sans-le-tete but otherwise quite whole in the center of our dining area.   The staff quickly and clearly disemboweled the creature and portioned the useable meat into distinct sections for each of the four of us. This was served over a delightfully fresh mix of vegetables and potato-based mash.   This rabbit did not die in vain.\n\nThe name \"La Salle A Manger\" may be better expressed as \"Le Plancher D'Abattage\", but if you're a carnivore you're in for a treat. The wine list is outstanding.  The service is exceptional.  The crowd is gorgeous.  The ambiance is slaughterhouse-chic.  \n\nA wonderful place to explore.   Worth every shot."], "5": ["If I could give this place six stars, I would. Five of us dined there the other night, sharing about 10 dishes, all of which but one were home runs.\n\nHighlights: \n- duck ravioli with fresh morels and foie gras - so great we got a second order. So many layers of umami in this dish, I could eat it every week and die a happy man.\n- lamb tartare. Who's heard of such a thing? I wish we'd had the room to order another serving.\n- grilled octopus with clams and lentils, and a strong hint of vanilla. The octopus was slightly over-charred, but the lentils were so unusual and and interesting, this was another home run for me.\n- lobster salad with asparagus - the perfect dish of the moment (early June). \n- halibut sashimi with black bean pur\u00e9e. So fresh and perfectly simple.\n- foie gras torchon with granny smith apple salad. What a perfect combination - could have been dessert. \n- the incredible charcuterie plate - something like 8 or 10 items, all healthy portions, for $16. (Shhhhh! Don't tell anyone - if too many people find out, they may raise the price.) All the charcuterie is housemade, and almost all the p\u00e2t\u00e9s, terrines, rillettes, etc. distinct and delicious. Consensus favourite was the pork liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.\n\nThe only disappointing dish was the stuffed duck leg - the only one we had from the Viande (mains) menu. The duck was kind of dry and underflavoured, and the foie gras side didn't quite make up for it.\n\nThe wine list: 90% French, intelligently chosen and with a lot of options in all price ranges. \n\nThe service: extremely professional, smooth, friendly and knowledgeable, in both languages.\n\nThe room: a bit loud - lots of hard surfaces - but great design (love the Edison bulbs) and a really fun, boistrous vibe. The kind of place you could come to for after-work drinks and snacks at the bar, for dessert at the end of the night, or - as we did - for a full-on, all night dinner. This is my favourite kind of restaurant - bravo!", "So good here! Big and open, sunny and warm, this place is really comfortable and fun. I've been here twice, once for an anniversary dinner, and once with another couple. While there are a number of private tables, our four-top was actually an eight-top that we shared with another party. But the high ceilings and great light-- maybe, I don't really know -- made it so our neighbours didn't make us feel uncomfortable or crowded. Instead, it just felt really fun and relaxed. It also helps that everyone in the place is young and beautiful. This place has an amazing vibe with a great wine list and a beautiful hanging light-bulb lit bar. The decor is definitely reminiscent of Au Pied du Cochon, but it's more open and not as dark, and less tables makes it less crowded. \n\nThe food was incredible. I've had beet salad with manchego cheese and pecans-- a dish I've attempted at home numerous times since. It was served on a narrow and long slab of wood-- it was pretty but made keeping everything off the table a little difficult. Maybe a little gimmicky. The venison carpaccio was beautiful and delicious-- although as other reviewers have pointed out, it really could ditch the mayo sauce.  My first experience with gnocchi was at this place. And although the creamy sauce was a bit rich for me, I've since craved it many times. The blood sausage was perfectly crumbly and buttery. The pork belly was crispy-- and had the melt in your mouth fattiness that tastes so good it's sooo worth the bad things it does to your arteries. I love meat-- one of those people who can't be friends with someone who orders a filet well-done-- and this place does pork and game right. The portions are quite generous, I've never been able to finish my mains. Accordingly, I can't comment on the desserts as I've never tried any. It's pricey, but nothing you wouldn't expect to pay for such bistro fare. \n\nMy only complaint with the place is that they didn't put enough cassis in my Kir. Also, while I found the view of the racks of animal carcasses in the back comforting and cool, it may make some squeamish, I guess.", "As a food connoisseur this is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. Certain dishes, like the venison, are served rare. I love it when restaurants are unwilling to compromise the look, texture, and taste of the dish. It's pricy, I was in for valentines day and we spent $150. We had 4 martinis, sparkling water (which was san pelegrino, non of that Perrier crap) and we split a salmon tartar appetizer. My main was venison, and my boyfriend has gnocchi gorgonzola. The gnocchi are recognizably made in the restaurant and their texture is fluffy and not at all gummy. My venison (deer) was delicious and did not have a game-y flavor. The plates are small so cheap fatties beware"]}}, "ntnhKjCbJ0fMZAxDJSHrpQ": {"reviews": {"1": ["Horrific.

Called & emailed the day before to say we'd be closer to 10.\n\nPoured out wine into the wrong people's glasses then tried to throw our glasses out. Even though we were only 9 people they forgot drinks. Tried to take away mid-done glasses of gin. Poured white wine into half filled glasses of people's ros\u00e9. The chef made a point of visiting the table once asked and was more than friendly but that didn't make up for the waitresses lack of attention. \n\nWe weren't allowed to only have portions for the number of people who showed up. We were stuck with the portions for 15 people despite telling them a day in advance and despite telling them at the time we were less people. It's a Friday night. It's IMPOSSIBLE that the food UNCOOKED would have gone bad before their next service. ENTIRELY un-effing-acceptable. I couldn't believe a restaurant would act so recklessly when it comes to people buying 7+ $8 drinks on top of 6 bottles of wine and gave advanced notice of a possibly smaller group. Then they decided to \"be nice\" and only charge us for 13 people. When the confirmation call for the reservation was made, we were told we could move chairs, and that a change in numbers wouldn't be a problem. As if that was some huge favor. They also accepted a reservation for 830, knowing that their service takes so long and that they were \"doing us a favor\" by staying open late while we waited for our food. Our main dishes hadn't even come by 10:50. The last service, the actual main dishes, they gave us only 3 portions instead of the 4. So they're charging us for 13 \"as a favor\" but giving us portions for 12. So much for a favor... and these dishes aren't even enough to be mains for individuals, sincerely nothing impression in regards to portion size. \n\nThe appetizers were good. The salads were awful. $12.80 bottle of SAQ wine for $38? That's way more than mark up.\n\nWould I come back as a a group? F*** no. As a couple? I would certainly come in and enjoy a couple of dishes with someone who could offer good conversation. The way this was treated as a smaller than expected group was entirely unacceptable and clearly avoidable. We tried to compensate with other purchases (like over priced wines and drinks) yet we were met with nothing more than callous disregard for repeat business. I would like to say that I wish the business the best of luck, but sincerely, I don't. \n\n$110 (18% added to the bill for tip despite the service by the waitress being less than prime to say the least) later I am SERIOUSLY disappointed.

Went to Rasoi a few weeks ago with a group of 14 people. We had a $35 4 course fixed menu. I knew we were off to a bad start when one of the group members showed up late and missed the first course.. and the servers refused to serve her the food she missed. Oh sorry, or she could PAY EXTRA to get the first course. We are talking about an onion bahji here... One little fried appetizer! Would it have been a trouble for them to bring it to her? Absolutely not. Service is off to a great start. From there things just went from bad to worse. The time between courses was a good 20-30 minutes, and the portions were oh so small! For a table of 4, we were served 3 pieces of shrimp. Three. When we inquired about the missing shrimp, we were told it was not missing. You only get 3 shrimp for 4 people, and 4 shrimp for 6 people... What!!! We were served lots of bland vegetables to fill in space. Finally we got the naan pizzas.. they were very tasty, but once again very small and not enough food. When we complained this time, the manager agreed to bring us an extra pizza. Wow finally doing something to accommodate! The curry dishes were good but by this time (I had probably been at the restaurant for almost 3 hours now), everyone was just pissed and it was hard to enjoy the meal. All the servers were so rude. It is unfortunate because the food is actually delicious but I will NEVER go back due to the extremely poor service.. these people don't know how to treat customers.

First, the location and decor are beautiful--classy, elegant, and relaxed.  Onto the issues:\n\n1.  Service was spotty.  On a recent Thursday evening, our server was nonexistent for much of our dinner.  For example, our bottle of wine sat on the table for more than 10 minutes until he walked by (finally) and realized that he forgot to open it.  I would have, of course, said something sooner had we been able to find him.\n\n2.  Despite our request to have the tapas ordered in a particular way, nothing came out from the kitchen with any logic or sequence.  So a meaty appetizer came out before a salad, which was then followed by the soup--not the way we requested it at all.\n\n3.  The food itself was very mixed.  The Mediterranean salad was creamy, because it suffered from too much cheese.  The bruschetta were perfect, so no complaints there.  But the gazpacho was extremely bland and lacked any evidence of seasoning.  The tomatoes tasted as if they had come straight from a food processor with no spicing at all.  Just cold pureed tomatoes--not the spirit of gazpacho at all.  \n\nWorse yet were the braised bison ribs, which the server described as done in an \"amazing\" cola sauce.  I've braised ribs and pork in coke numerous times.  The flavor should be slightly sweet and deep.  These were super-sweet and bland at the same time.  Once again, the food lacked any seasoning whatsoever.

If you want to know what going to Le Local feels like, pull out a few $20 bills, spread some butter on it and eat it.  Wash it down with some water and pretend you just drank a cocktail.\n\nIt amazes me that this place has over 3 stars, especially after eating at various local restaurants in the area.  After a week of dining in and around Montreal (Vieux Montreal mostly) I can safely say this place is one of the most expensive places I visited and had the worst food overall.\n\nHow do you screw up Poutine??  For those that don't know Poutine, it's a local favorite in Montreal, combining french fries with cheese curds, topped with delicious gravy.  And somehow Le Local found a way to screw up this simple recipe.\n\nMy wife and I bought two drinks (a Mojito and a Martini) and they were both diluted to the point where it was hard to distinguish it from plain water. Oh, and they were $10+ each.  Needless to say, we didn't order another.\n\nNext up - the bread.  I rarely ever comment on bread, but it was so terrible I feel the need to warn others.  For a restaurant that charges as much as it does, having stale bread that tastes like you're chewing on someone else's gum is just unacceptable.  How about serving some freshly baked bread, preferably something with flavor?\n\nThe only saving grace was the Veal Burger, which was pretty damn good.  Not good enough to warrant the price, but it was good.  I don't even remember what my wife ordered - it was some odd tasting fish that she didn't eat.\n\nOverall this was a giant skid mark in an otherwise splendid trip to Montreal.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  Anywhere else.  It's hard to find something that's worse.", "This is a difficult review to write because the food was actually very good, really, exceptional given the price.  The problem was the service, which was unprofessional, sloppy, and generally disappointing:  it takes a special type of bad service to overshadow such good food, but Le Local nailed it.  \n\nFirst, it was *insanely* slow.  Two and a half hours to get two courses is just nuts.  I am sure there are tables that like to linger, but it is really brutal to sit there for more than an hour after finishing your appetizers waiting for a main course.  Among other things, we were hungry.  There is just no excuse to completely ignore a table for that long.\n\nSecond, and massively compounding the first problem, we had to ask repeatedly when anyone ordered a drink.  Setting aside that this was irritating, it was also strange:  Le Local easily lost out on $100+ of high margin revenue from a single four-top simply because it was difficult to order drinks and the drinks didn't come when ordered.  (And I should be clear, no one had more than two drinks during the nearly three hours between the time we walked in the door and the time we walked out.  It's not as if we were boozing it up.)\n\nThird, the waiter was kind of a jerk.  Two guys at the table (one in particular) were your basic steak and potatoes guys.  Sure, the one guy's questions about what food was were incredibly basic, but there was no need to be patronizing to him, which our waiter was.  And there was *zero* degree of attentiveness (although, in fairness, since we had no food at our table for most of the time we were there, I'm not sure what there was to attend to).  \n\nFourth, the waiter omitted key information.  In particular, the medium rare steak was prepared exactly the way I like my steaks, which is to say it was really what most people think of as rare (red).  The problem is that it wasn't my steak, and the guy who ordered it wanted it cooked the way you usually think of medium rare (basically pink, with a tiny bit of red in the center).  You shouldn't  serve someone a red \"medium rare\" steak without mentioning it to them first.\n\nBottom line:  the food is (extremely) good, but it's some of the worst service I've ever experienced.  Skip it.\n\n*******************************\n\nThe above is offered with one quasi-caveat.  There are two tables in the dining room that are either amazing or terrible based on your group's preference, basically, they are right on top of the open kitchen, so you have to be okay with a bell getting rung in your ear periodically.  We were shown one of them:  I would have really liked the table, but everyone else in my group was uncomfortable with the set-up.  For that reason, they seated us in the lounge.  Maybe the service in the dining room would have been better.  (But if so, that still doesn't get them off the hook, with two tables that offer such an incredibly specific experience, a restaurant with any focus on the customer would have asked me if I wanted that table when they called to confirm my reservation.)", "We had to wait 30 min Eventhough we had a reservation."], "2": ["Cool House music.

Most Montrealers think this place is average at best, unless you're a little bimbo who thinks you're participating in some \"scene\" by being there. \n\nThe food is pretty good but the experience is ruined by idiot waiters making $5 an hour who treat the patrons like garbage, crowding them at the bar, ignoring them, and then berating them when they try to select the appropriate bottle of wine. Which, I might add, I don't think any waiter in there could ever afford on their salaries. \n\nNow I try not to judge a place on one visit unless it's really good, so I gave it another chance and went back a few months later. Same bullshit experience. Then again, a few months later, for someone's birthday. SAME thing.

We eventually had to go order at the bar, because of the lack of service. Then, it took another 30 minutes to receive our appetizer and 45 minutes after that for our main course to arrive.

We are big fans of indian food and we tried a lot of different restaurants in the neighbouring area. Unfortunately, Punjab Palace was the worst. The veggie thali lacked substance and taste, while the butter chicken was extremely sweet and dry. However, the lamb curry was not bad.

Believe it or not, two can eat here (and I meat EAT, like you may have to unbotton whilst leaving the resto) for $25 tip in. \n\nThe waiters are attentive, but good family-style service aside, their food is absolutely delicious, I can't honestly say I haven't enjoyed every single thing I've had, and I've pretty much done the menu. But then again, this is food you will respect in the morning! It's spicy in all the right places, and the fact that you can bring your own wine (for free, some of us Montrealers take this for granted!), and works well with large groups too. \n\nTheir (classic) butter chicken is worth it alone. I am a butter chicken snob and this one fits the bill. Garlic naan is a must. And the point about reserving ahead is valid, but if you happen to drop by unannounced and they can't accomodate, there are at least 2 acceptable places in the immediate vacinity that will feed you. But this one is definetely worth the wait if there is one. \n\nNote to the reader! I'm a HUGE fan of all things Indian so this doesn't really bother me, but just in case you're sensitive to these types of things... this resto doesn't have the best ventillation and the wafts of kitchen air spill freely into the dining room.

Hands down, the best Indian in Montreal.", "The Punjab Palace is  my favorite Indian restaurant in Montreal (out of, say, the dozen or so that I've been to, including the more expensive Taj downtown).  I've probably eaten there more than any other restaurant in the city over the years but that probably says even more about their prices than it does their food (but not about its vicinity - it's a bit of a hike north and not too accessible to public transportation). It's not only bring your own wine (and beer), but it's pretty hard to get out of there spending more than 15 bucks per person with tax and tip (including appetizers, main course, nan, etc).\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure that I agree with the review below that claims the service is good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty bad. Come to think of it, it's just outright awful. I've waited twenty minutes just to get a menu (having to wildly flag down the server). Even when the places is half-empty, the service is still pretty bad. But if you factor the price in, you can accept it with zen-like serenity.  However, I'd advise that the restaurant is  not only bring your own wine but preferably bring your own wine opener too.  We started bringing ours because we struggled so many times to get the attention of the server to come over and open our bottles.  Once the bottles are open and alcohol is flowing, waiting is less frustrating. In fact, the last time we did that, our waiter ended up borrowing ours. Of course, he disappeared with it and then we had to hunt him down to get it back when we were ready for the next bottle.\n\nBut enough about bottle openers. The Punjab has a fried fish appetizer (damn if I don't forget what it's called) that's spectacular. The only dud is the vindaloo which is not only not spicy but somewhat flavorless.  Everthing else is a winner.", "Went there for a late lunch so the service was excellent since my girlfriend and I were the only ones when we arrived. We quickly ordered one veggie thali for her and one non-veggie thali for myself. The non-veggie thali came with butter chicken and savory well spiced lamb and a daal which was also great (and I'm not a fan of daal). My girlfriend had a great very fresh  tasting and looking palak paneer (beautiful not over cooked bright greet colour) which was my favourite item, spice wise, which I can neither adequately name or describe, except that it was intricately spiced well beyond any dish that I've had there or any restaurant in that area (large pieces of cinnamon bark and cardamom pods present which was really nice).    \nVeggie thali was $5 and the non-veggie was $6."]}}, "UMEO57Rwl4_wsGm9KTbjtQ": {"reviews": {"3": ["This place is cute and small.

Before anyone says anything, I know. People who go out for Christmas must be hated by their families, right? Well, it may just be the other way around, first off. Anyhow....my husband and I understand it's Christmas and most people don't want to be working on that day. We get it. However, when we walked up to the host and said, \"We have reservations for 5:30,\" and he said, \"Tonight? Oh, we don't have anything available,\" when we were the ONLY people there, didn't start off well at all. When I reiterated, \"We have reservations...McCormack at 5:30. On Open Table....\" he was like, \"Oh! Well, we aren't ready. Please sit at the bar first. Have something on me.\" Huh. Okay.\n\nSo we sat at the bar. The bartender was definitely frazzled...looked like she was still cleaning up from the brunch shift. Okay. No problem. I asked if she could make an extra dirty martini. She looked at me and said, \"I'll have to go downstairs for olive juice.\" Um...okay? Again, I realize it's Christmas, so I say, \"No. I don't want to bother you. I'll just take a whiskey on the rocks. What do you have?\" She named several I'd never heard of but offered the bottle of one to sniff. Okay. We'll take two. Ridiculously smooth...Dullamore? (Not Tullamore...we know that one.) Anyhow...it was nice and then two other groups got seated while we still sat at the bar waiting. Huh. Well, I know it's a slower pace here so we were patient and finished our whiskey and then a different host sat us. \n\nDinner tonight was a $50 prix fixe. Seemed decent to us. We selected appetizers and dinners. I had the foie gras...something I had heard Montreal was well known for. Ugh. It tasted like strong liverwurst. That was my fault. I should never have ordered it not sure if I'd like it. My husband had a salmon appetizer that he said was \"fishy and chewy\". Neither of us finished our appetizers, but again...probably our fault.\n\nSalads came out...they were tiny little piles of grassy leaves with one slice of an orange, four cranberries, and a dollop of vinegar. Meh.\n\nMy husband had boeuf bourguignon..but with medallions of beef as well as pork...quite good. However, the beef had several, rather tough, chewy portions...sinewy...something one wouldn't expect from a restaurant like this. I had a risotto that was more like a bouillabaisse. It was good, but definitely needed some salt. \n\nDessert was a molten chocolate cake...that came out like two little bear turds....no lie. And they tasted about as wonderful (or at least I think bear turds probably taste like this). They were flavorless, unsweetened globs of chocolate that I took one bite of and left. I NEVER leave chocolate. EVER. \n\nOkay....ALL of this could be tolerated because it was Christmas...no one wants to work on Christmas. I get it. The death knell came when I asked the waitress for our check. She asked, \"All on one?\" -____- Are you kidding me? We are a couple out for dinner on Christmas. Do you think this is a blind date?? Do you think that, because I'm older than my husband, we're going Dutch??? I became severely annoyed at this...but my husband said the girl was young, she doesn't know. We look at the bill. Our whiskeys \"on me\" (the host) were on our bill at $15 each. Really?? Okay. I calm down. I get it. Probably not your best servers on tonight. We pay and go to get our coats from the coat check. No one has time to look at us. (Mind you, the restaurant still has several open tables...) I counted to thirty with a $2 tip and my coat check ticket in my hand. I then put my scarf and gloves on and went to the coat rack and retrieved our coats myself. We walked out with no one batting an eye. \n\nHonestly? The food was okay. Not worth the $50, though. I enjoyed my entire night, even with the lackluster food, until the unwitting comment from the young server. I'm sorry, but for the price and snootiness of the place, they need to train their help better. I'd skip this and try one of the many, MANY other places right around the area for dinner.

During the night more customers did eventually arrive, but it was never more than half full. For Valentine's Day evening, that is indeed a red flag, particularly for a French bistro, which you'd think would be packed on Valentine's Day.\n\nThe menu included a fixed price option as well as a la carte. As someone who detests fixed price menus, I was pleased to have the a la carte option available.\n\nThe bread came to the table first. It seemed like the Wunderbread version of a baguette. It came with little butter packages you get in a food court or on an airplane.\n\nAs an appetizer I ordered the ravioli dish, which consisted of a bowl filled with little miniature green bowties that could not possibly have been homemade and I'm guessing must have come frozen in a bag. They were all piled in a heap. The sauce and the ravioli were bland and lacked seasoning. It was not terrible, but not good either. \n\nFor my main course I ordered the bavette steak, cooked blue. The steak was more medium rare than blue, not that it mattered since it was smothered in goopy sauce that made it pretty well impossible to taste the steak. You could barely see the meat there was so much sauce. again the steak was bland and needed salt (you sense a theme here). The fries that came with the steak were adequate, but... surprise surprise, totally lacking salt. \n\nIt does appear the chef does not believe in seasoning the food. Either that or the boxed / frozen food he is reheating isn't seasoned well out of the package.\n\nFor dessert, I did want to order the Tarte Tatin, which was on the a la carte menu, but before I could do so they brought me the chocolate mousse cake, which I guess was the mandatory dessert on the fixed price menu (never mind that I had not ordered the fixed price meal) but they didn't charge me for it, so I didn't really complain. \n\nTo be fair, my wife and my friend and his girlfriend indicated they enjoyed it. To me it was like one of the desserts you get from Via Rail in their first class cabin - basically a notch or two above airplane food.\n\nBottom line: This is the kind of restaurant that would have done just fine in the 1980's as a \"fancy\" restaurant for the suburbs.

But call me old-school, I miss the level of professionalism the wait staff displayed, even in a small restaurant setting. There's no reason not to get proper service in any restaurant, it's well part of the experience.", "Just ok. Bring your own bottle. Service is good though", "I went there for a quiet tete-a-tete and I got what I expected. \nIt's a straight to the point bistro although I would love it if they changed a few of the little elements of the decor (you'll now what I mean). \nFood is ok. Service is fine. \nNot the best place out there but an easy pick when you don't know where to go and want to get something nice and french."], "4": ["I don't live in Montreal, but had recently visited for a week.  Before I had lived in France for a year, and have had French food all over France, and also here back home in San Francisco.  I have to say Le Paris was my quintessential French culinary experience in Montreal.\n\nLe Paris represents what Montreal is all about for me --- France without the pretentiousness.  I say that for several reasons.  First, the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Unlike your typical rude and arrogant waitstaff in a Parisian restaurant, the staff here is willing to speak in English, and they are patient when it comes explaining things on the menu, and may even engage you in a conversation about the food or what not.  Second, the prices are much more affordable than in France.  A nice three course meal, which includes an entree (which in French means the appetizer), the plat principal (the main course), and dessert, can be had for around $25, which is unthinkable for Paris or San Francisco, for the kind of quality you get here.  \n\nThe food is classic French, leaning more towards southern country cooking, with a focus on hearty and rich ingredients, like red meats and animal organs.  Many of the dishes are stewed or braised in herbs and wine, which is typical of provincial cooking.  Some of these classic dishes include Poule au Pot (chicken braised in broth sauce), Beef Bourguinon (beef stew in red wine sauce), which are all offered on the menu here.  \n\nI ate there twice during my visit.  I had a number of things but I will describe the best dish that I had, which was Magret de Canard (duck breast).  For those of you unfamilar with this dish, it is similar in some way to steak.  The duck breast is either seared in a frying pan, or broiled in the oven, or often both, and then finished with a reduction sauce made from its juices and red wine.  It's not as easy as it sounds, because the duck breast is leaner, and thus tougher than many cuts of steak, so if not prepared correctly, can come out tough, which was often the case in the couple other occassions when I had it (in restaurants in France mind you).  \n\nSo I was met with a bit of trepidation when I saw the meat presented on my plat pre-cut, which means the chef had already sliced the meat into pieces, instead of presenting it as a whole breast with cut marks on the top, which is the customary way in France.  My concern was that the meat had lost a lot of its natural juices by being pre-cut.  But one bite into it had totally put me at ease.  The meat was juicy and every bit as flavorful as it should had been, with that hint of gaminess that is the reason why you would order duck instead of beef.  It was perfectly cooked --- medium rare with red juices running out as you slice the meat.  The breast had a thin layer of fat on top, whch was charred to a slight crisp.  This added some nice fatty flavor to the meat.  It was excellent with a glass of argetine trapiche pinot noir.  Le Paris did an excellent job in preparing this dish I would say.\n\nThe clientele tends to be older, and they look like they've been coming to the place for years.  I find it sad that not more young people would enjoy such solid traditiaonal French fare.  And they never seem too busy for you to be able to grab a table almost right away.  I hope they get good business, because a great place like this deserves to stay in business for a long time.", "This was the first place that I ever had duck confit.  And it was delicious! Different but delicious!\n\nI also had the fish soup which was very good and hit the spot on the very chilly Montreal day that I went.", "We luck out every time we visit, they seem to have the table by the front window.\nWe really appreciate the way we are served, it's always the same waiter who has a great sense of humor.\nAll the dishes we've had have been great.\nDecor hasn't changed in a lonnnng time but hey it's got it's own unique appeal."], "5": ["Probably one of the better dining experiences I've had in my life. \nI'm not an expert on french cuisine nor have I dined extensively in montreal or anything like that but if you're in town, check this place out, trust me!\n\nThis is basically a real casual bistro in Montreal, filled with older French Canadians, a lot of retired people, or a generally 40yr + crowed. It feels like the decor hasn't changed for the past 30 years and it really sets a nice mood. \n\nI've come here once for the duck confit and once for a roasted fish. both times, it was like eating a really experienced french grandmaother's cooking in the french countryside: just simply but expertly prepared. Normally, a fish would be served with a side of roasted vegetables and potatoes, and some pan drippings and it really is fantastic. \n\nThe best thing about this entire restaurant is the brandade de morou. This tasted amazing and is one of the most memorable things I've ever eaten. Its basically like mashed potatoes that tastes like the sea, and ive never had this dish better than the one they have here. Other apetizers included some squid cooked in its own ink and some oysters, all of which were really good. \n\nThe bread is fantastic. The butter comes room temperate and softened. I'm not a wine expert but the waiters were friendly and happy to help. \n\nOverall, this is truly a great place. Reservations are recommended. This is an ideal place to compensate if your not lucky enough to have a french grandmother.", "Restaurant Le Paris is a small bistro that's conveniently located on Rue Catherine ouest.  HOWEVER, it's not well known.\n \nI discovered the bistro after asking my hotel's concierge back in 2007.  My friends and I went after skiing in Tremblant.  We enjoyed really good kidneys and the chef was kind enough to let us try some cow brains.  I've also had the cow brains at Per Se in NYC.  I'm done with cow brains.  I'm not a fan.  It's just too much.  I'm getting sick of foie gras these days too.\n \nJe suis desole for disgressing... Le Paris is a small bistro worth visiting!", "As tourists from Illinois our large group of 10 people wasn't sure we could find a restaurant with Montreal flavor, a reasonable price, good food, and able to accommodate our large group.  Happily we gave Le Paris a try based on good reviews and we were soooo happy we did.  We were  made to feel at home immediately and that warmth lasted through the evening.  The food was delicious, was served to our group all at the same time and was as authentically French as other reviewers have said.

Avoid \"Tacos al pastor\" they are an insult to anyone that has ever tried the real thing: the meat is not cooked shawarma style like in Mexico, the seasoning does not resemble at all, the pineapple comes from a can, and they don't even have salsa for it.  The service from one of the servers was extremely rude but the other server was aware of this and made his best effort to make it up. I wonder why the chef or owner felt the need to serve some bizarre dishes and just name them as if the name alone would make them authentic. Why don't you just simply say : it's Mexican inspired, or tex mex? Most restauranteurs have the pre conceived notion than Canadians won't like authentic Mexican food, but most Canadians I know love the real thing when they try it. Hopefully one day they will take a hint!", "Hmmm no not for me. I had the burrito lunch special and it was okay but not something I would go back for. \n\nThe burrito itself was leaking some fatty liquid that I am still unsure of..There was hardly any cheese on top and it had some tomato sauce reminiscent of canned sauce.

On both poutines (on two separate occasions), the fries were fresh and well cooked but the cheese was average.

It is actually just the same as a regular poutine (chicken gravy, fries, chesse), but with the addition of the \"mexican\" sauce that they use as a side for french fries orders: tomatoes, hot peppers and corriander.

I'm not going to pretend I remember what kind of sauce we had (D thinks it was a sun-dried tomato and basil, all I know is that it was good). But like I just said in the parenthetical there, it was damn tasty. The guy told us what most people go for, and we went for something else. But I have a feeling that it wouldn't have mattered. I'm sure they were all solid. \n\nI don't know what else they serve nor do I much care. If you're here for a review of anything else on the menu, sorry to disappoint but this is all I got. I guess in a way this is how I like to approach things. Don't go to a diner for the smoked halibut dinner platter. Likewise, don't go to a French fry joint and get a Caesar salad.

It was cooked medium-rare as asked, but still very tough. I've been to this restaurant twice before and was not disappointed. This time, I'm reconsidering going back......", "Let me first start by saying that I view TasteMTL/MTLaTable as a great opportunity for new and existing restaurants to wow us with their culinary prowess.  That being said, mediocre just doesn't cut it for me. \n\nLocation: On McGill in the Old Port, a few minutes walk from Square Victoria. Easily accessible. \n\nVibe: Personally, I loved B&B's space, With its high ceilings and elegant decor, the space felt open and not at all confined. The purple lighting accents totally worked. \n\nService: Just OK. I felt that the wait staff could have been more attentive, particularly since the restaurant only had a few patrons. I didn't like where our table was located - right in front of the kitchen entrance. There were constant comings and goings that I found annoying as all hell. That, and they easily could have given us another table - the restaurant was emoty when we arrived and empty when we left SO..... \n\nFood: I specifically went for Taste MTL, so stuck with that particular menu (see my pic for full menu details). What I had: \n\nSquash soup with smoked trout: This was a total miss for me. While I liked the texture and consistency of the soup (super creamy), it tasted like, well, nothing. I did not taste the squash, which is essentially what I was looking forward to, and I could smell the smoked trout way more than I could taste it. Served lukewarm on a very cold evening. Um, what?  I also tried the mussels - ugh! To me, it tasted like the bottom of the ocean. Fishy and just, ugh!\n\nChicken with parsnips and mashed potatoes: The chicken had a nice flavor, but it was a little on the dry side. There was definitely not enough broth on this dish. The parsnips were tasty but a little undercooked for my taste. The mashed potatoes? Well, for me they were the best part of the meal. Loved them. The minimal broth or sauce in the dish had a nice flavor - too bad there wasn't more of it.  My friend ordered the salmon and the first thing I thought when I saw that dish was 'It's so brown.' Yep.\n\nLemon tart: I had high hopes for dessert but this didn't really work for me. This was more of a lemon mousse than anything else. It was extremely tart yet very sweet at the same time. The graham crust while thin, had a very pronounced flavor that really just didn't work with the lemon, in my opinion. \n\nOverall, this place was a miss for me. It just felt like they didn't go to any trouble to develop a menu for the week. My table concluded that these dishes represented a total lack of effort on Bar & Boeuf's part. A very underwhelming experience."], "3": ["Had a nice supper here with some out of town friends and their adorable and extremely well mannered kids. The waiter was very attentive and accommodate the little girl's request for a slight change in her dish. The food was impeccably plated, the presentation was on par and the food was delicious. The ambience was a little quiet as the music was a tad low but we had plenty of conversation to keep us entertained. All in all I recommend it as a solid eatery with excellent service and a wide variety of friendly dishes to please everybody's tastes."], "4": ["Coming off our prior evening at L'Orignal, my friend and I wanted a dining experience that would be close to that standard.  The concierge recommended Bar & Beouf.  The restaurant, we were told by the hostess, was not typically open on a Sunday, but they were this evening with a 5 course prix frie menu for $45 (I think--I hope I'm not misremembering things).  The first part of the dinner was an amuse-bouche of salmon tartare (I think) on piece of baguette.  Very tasty, but not the highlight of the meal (then again, it isn't supposed to be!).  The next course offered a choice of salad or a cold pea soup. My friend got the soup and enjoyed it; I had the salad and enjoyed the perfectly ripe tomatoes.  Tasty, but nothing to write home about.  The next course were small tomatoes with this amazing (AMAZING!) mozarella cheese foam.  It was a delightful take on a caprese salad.  The cheese foam (seriously--that couldn't have been a block of cheese) was so light and the tastes were brought out in a way that the cheese alone wouldn't have done.  Our main entree was either a beef pot roast (sorry, I don't speak or read French, so this is the closest I am getting) that my friend ordered.  I tried it--it was delicious.  Perfectly tender and melted away in your mouth.  I had the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection.  Dessert was a large piece of brownie with whipped cream and some ice cream on top.  I was so stuffed I couldn't finish the dessert, and wished I could pack it away for later that evening.\n\nBar & Boeuf was a wonderful experience.  The atmosphere is a tad cold, but that wasn't helped since the place wasn't that busy (again, they said they weren't usually open on a Sunday, but they had a large group eating in the one section of the restaurant).  The wait staff was very attentive to our table.  The tomato and cheese salad dish bumped this up to 4-stars for me.  I want to go back when their normal menu is in use.", "We arrived in Montreal earlier this afternoon, exhausted after a 6 hour drive from Buffalo and really just wanting a good, non-fast-food meal before crashing for the night. After walking around the neighborhood and not finding very many options open tonight (it's Tuesday night), we hopped in to Bar & Boeuf because it looked like a much better option than the diner across the street. :) \n\nWe were greeted warmly and seated quickly; I'm definitely thankful for the availability of a coat check. Also, decent wine selection; I really enjoyed a glass of pinot noir that I'm kicking myself for not writing down the name of. \n\nI started with the green salad; the greens were fresh, crispy, and perfectly dressed. Nothing really special, but after a day of driving and eating horrible fast food, I attacked that salad like a ravenous wolf. Vegetation = yum. My husband and I also split the heirloom tomato salad, and we were surprised at how sweet and juicy the tomatoes were given the fact that it's the middle of February! The Bufala Mozzarella had a whipped, almost foamy texture -- it was the perfect, light start to the meal. \n\nMy husband ordered the Black Angus Beef, which was good but tasted as if it might have spent a little too much time marinating; the taste of the marinade overpowered the beef somewhat. However, the accompanying fries were fresh and crispy, and the seasoning on the fries complemented the beef well. \n\nThe thing I really want to write about, though, is the braised pig chuck. The server told me it was their specialty, and they definitely deliver on that. OMG. The pork was super tender, topped with a really nice burgundy mushroom sauce and a perfectly poached egg. The dish was so very homey -- exactly the comfort food I was needing. It was served atop mashed potatoes that were mixed with cheese curds. It was so good, I have to say it twice: MASHED POTATOES MIXED WITH CHEESE CURDS. Seriously yum.\n\nI'm ready to crash asleep right now, but that pork was so good I had to Yelp it right away. If you find yourself at Bar & Boeuf, definitely make it a point to order the pig chuck -- it's a must.", "A very last minute trip brought me to Montreal and of course to my original disappointment I couldn't get a table at any of the places I had my heart set on; however the two of us foodies watched the disappointment disappear as we started our meal at Bar & Boeuf.  The Sommelier had a strong knowledge of the mainly European wine section and helped guide us to something that matched well with what we were ordering.  The king mushrooms and scallops both were average compared to the MUST try main course of the PIG CHUCK.  WOW is all I can say and no knife required for this great dish.  If you're a foodie it's worth checking out.  The atmosphere was solid; it wasn't so loud you couldn't carry on a conversation with someone next to you, but it had a vibe."], "5": ["Ended up here for dinner because I was an idiot and didn't call for reservations early enough for Au Pied du Cochon and then decided to give this place a shot in place of it. What a great choice it turned out to be.\n\nSo I figured what the hell and went for the 7 course meal with wine pairings. It was beyond awesome although the sitting ended up taking almost 4 hours which had to be the longest dinner I've ever had.\n\nThe selections were all pretty good but my favorites were the duck foie gras, country bread and the beef. All the wine pairings were very good and the explanations from the waiter and sommelier were helpful and interesting.\n\nSo if your looking for a food orgy followed by a long food coma while amazingly not feeling stuffed go here. You will not be disappointed.", "WOW!  This is why Yelp* exists!  Was sitting in my hotel room in Montreal thinking about where to enjoy a Saturday night dinner out on the town and came across Bar & Boeuf on Yelp and made a reservation via Open Table.  Great location and from the moment I walked in the door until I left in a nirvanic haze some three and a half hours later, I was treated like a king!  A very strong wine list coupled with an innovative menu and gorgeous plating made for an unforgettable dining experience.  Listening to other diners around me I feel pretty comfortable in saying that everyone was enjoying their meals as much as I did!  I can without hesitation recommend the Heirloom Tomato/Buffala Mozzarella appetizer and the (now famous) Pig Chuck.    Take a spin on their very informative (and bilingual!) website and look forward to a great evening.", "What a great restaurant, try the menu degustation with the wine pairing, it is simply excellent!

I ordered the beer and bacon mussels and my coworker ordered the white wine mussels, both with fries. I wish I would have gone with the salad and some pasta instead...\n\nFirst, the \"frites\" were a tiny bowl of McCain frozen shoestring fries. The mussels, however, were served in a large portion. Although our waiter assured us \"the best mussels in Montreal\" they were rubbery and mediocre at best. The sauce was surprisingly quite flavourless. Although my coworker finsihed his bowl (he's Belgian and they love their mussels) I barely finished half of it.\n\nThey also had a wide selection of shitty Molson beers on tap and bottle.\n\nIn the end the bill came to $40 for two bowls of shitty mussles and frozen McCain fries.

They also have a fireplace in the back to make it cozy.\n\nThe first time I went, it was pretty good.  I ordered a Caesar salad and pizza.  The salad was absolutely drenched in dressing (which was bland and off-tasting at the same time).  The pizza was pretty good, although for a $14 personal size pizza, the toppings were quite skimpy.  However, it was pretty tasty and cheesy.  The crust was thick and crusty...I happen to like that.  The portions were pretty large, and I had enough for a second meal.\n\nI liked it enough that I went a second time.  I figured since it was my last day there, I'd stick with what I knew.  I got there around 11 AM, and I ordered the pizza with pepperoni instead of sausage this time.  This time, they were totally unprepared for lunch.  My table was dirty, and they actually served toast instead of dinner bread.  The pizza took 30 minutes, and the pepperoni and crust were still undercooked.  I only ate maybe 2 slices and left the rest.  I was so disappointed.\n\nIt seems like a convenient, OK place for locals to grab a quick lunch, but that's all of the potential I see for this place.

We waited about 8 minutes before someone even talked to us to take our order. While we waited, we looked around and the food didn't even look fresh in the display cases.

We weren't going to be loud or obnoxious, so please, stop giving us dirty looks.\n\nPerfectly situated in the older section of Montreal, the inn is within walking distance of many of the sites within old Montreal.

The room had views of a cathedral and its gardens, which probably would have been beautiful in the spring, but was not very impressive in the fall (obviously not the fault of the garden). Now, I'm not really accustomed to nice hotels, so I was quite impressed with the elegant hardwood floors, the wall sconce equipped with dimmers, the comfortable bed, the clean bathroom...etc etc. Perhaps I'm not the best one to say this, but it's definitely one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever had the pleasure of staying in.

We didn't spend much time in the room, but it was absolutely lovely -- a double and a queen bed, double jacuzzi tub, clean, quiet, and with a view of the back of the Notre-Dame Basilica! The room rate also included breakfast at Bonaparte Restaurant -- the French Toast, made with French bread from the previous night's dinner service was out of this world. There was also parking available for a small fee ($10?), free wi-fi, and a computer and printer for guests in the lounge.\n\nWe also ate dinner at Bonaparte restaurant, and loved it. My dad and I are big foodies, while my mom has pretty simple tastes, and we all agreed it was one of the best meals we'd ever had. Recommendations: The lobster special w/ vanilla-muscat sauce sounded like it would be too sweet, but was perfect. The mushroom ravioli was exquisite, with paper-thin pasta encasing an amazingly complex mushroom filling. And the fois gras duo was perfect fois... need I say more? The steak tartare was huge, and in my opinion a little overseasoned, but that may just have been because it was my third course, and I was approaching saturation by that point. \n\nBy far the best feature of both the hotel and restaurant was the service, which was unobtrusive but amazingly considerate. Examples: my dad mentioned that we were celebrating my graduation from grad school, and the server brought me a complementary little bottle of ice cider that paired perfectly with my fois. (And a pen from the restaurant, which was a cute touch.) Even better, I went down to the lounge to read at about 11:30 pm. I was worried that since it was so late, they might be closing up. But I sat down in the empty lounge and started reading... within 5 minutes, the music had been changed to a soft instrumental track, candles were lit on all the tables, the fireplace was turned on, and the waiter from dinner appeared to offer me \"something to help me read.\" Amazing, and totally exemplary of the entire experience at Bonaparte -- the staff didn't just make sure we had a nice time, but obviously enjoyed our enjoyment of the whole weekend.

Hands down. \n\nYou won't find valet, table cloths, D-D waitresses, or champagne here. Instead, you will find some very authentic mexican tacos with good queso, pasztor, and all other goodies. \n\nDrinks are simple. You get your standard Mexican Jumex, Jarritos, and other Mexican drinks as well as some Mexican beers. \n\nFood is great. All tacos are awesome. Pasztor is properly done. La Gringa deserves special mention. La Matraca sandwich is mind-blowing. Especially combined with one of their 3 signature sauces (which I literally spooned). \n\nTheir terrace is not bad, however it is facing busy St. Denis. Good for watching your car not to get a ticket. Bad to relax. Oh, and they should definitely throw out those disgustingly uncomfortable wooden terrace chairs. \n\nAll in all - great mexican food, cheap, and authentic.

The food is OK, but a tad pricey for the quality. The staff was pretty nice and the dessert was scrumptuous.", "My wonderful personal Yelp guide to Montreal, Mister O., and I met to try out Vargas on a cool evening last week--perfect weather for a carnivorous foray into one of the city's premiere steakhouses.\n\nWe arrived a bit early for our reservation, so decided to indulge in a drink at the bar. All beautifully polished wood, the bar (and restaurant itself) was quite large and the bartender, friendly. Unfortunately, she seemed not to be terribly familiar with how to prepare his martini or my lemondrop martini, which came out a bit frothy and not nearly citrusy enough for my taste. Still, my companion and I enjoyed sitting at the bar, chatting about hockey, and stealing glances at the NHL game on the bar TV.\n\nWhen we were ready to be seated, we were led through the grand dining room to a table near the window. As I read through the menu, I realized there wasn't any sushi. I know, not odd for a steakhouse--except for one that touts having a sushi chef, as I'd read about Vargas in several places. In fact, the only sushi I saw was a roll on the appetizer menu.\n\nRegardless, I was more than happy enough to stick with steak. After deliberating between the rack of lamb and rib steak, we decided to order both and share, with me selecting the Montreal-spiced rib eye. Both entrees came with a choice of potato (baked, twice baked, fries, Yukon gold mashed) or seasonal vegetables. Mr. O. went with the vegetables and a side order of fries, while I got the twice-baked potato.\n\nWe both started with a Caesar salad, which was surprisingly large for a side salad. The dressing was creamy and cheesy, and quite delicious. When the steak arrived, it seemed to overwhelm the plate, and the twice-baked potato was nearly obliterated by its 17 oz. heft. I had ordered it medium-rare, and to my taste it could have been a bit more rare. As I took my first bite, the Montreal spice (seasoned salt, pepper, various herbs, mustard seeds) hit my tastebuds--a little salty but very good. The shiraz we'd ordered was perfect with the steak, as it was able to hold its own against the spices.\n\nService was always attentive, but rather amusing. The waiter, for whom English was not his first language though he spoke it impeccably, had a catch-all phrase that he used throughout the meal, \"The worst is over.\" When I placed my order, he said, \"The worst is over,\" and again when he poured my wine, and at various other points of the meal. I had to ask Mr. O. if this was a Canadian phrase and he said it wasn't. But it was charming and funny.\n\nIn all, the evening and meal were very pleasant. For Vargas, I give 3 stars. The minuses were the bad martinis and slightly overcooked steak. The flavor of the steak was a definite plus.\n\nIf I were reviewing the company alone, I would give 5 stars to the experience of dining with Mister O.--a true raconteur and superb guide to Montreal, without whom I would have missed a lot of wonderful food.

I'll have to give it a second chance to see if they have improved.", "I had a few turn-offs with this place and one good thing to say.  Let's start with the good:\n-- the taco I ordered was tasty.  Taste is the reason the rating went up from one star to two stars.\n\nNow for the bad:\n-- the price.  Yelp has this place listed with one dollar sign ($) but I have to disagree.  I paid $3 for a very small taco.  Took me three bites to eat it.  That's $1 a bite.  It wasn't at all filling.  When I walked up to the cashier and asked for one taco, his reply was, \"is that it?\"  I began to suspect something might be wrong but said nothing.  There was some sort of shift change occurring and so there was a five minute wait while that occurred.  When the new person came on, he confirmed my order with me and said, \"is that it?\"  This time, I came right out and said, \"well, I don't know.  How big are your tacos?  That's what the last guy said.  Are they small or something?  I figured for $3 they must be pretty big.\"  He held up a taco and I saw it was pretty small but went ahead with the order anyways, out of embarrassment--I wasn't going to just walk out of the place with my friend.  So, for tacos at least, it's too pricey.  My friend ordered a burrito and it was around $7, so maybe that's approaching a little more reasonable.  On the other hand, the soft drink cups for the soda pop fountain are $3.50.  Are you serious?!  Way too expensive.  My advice would be to lower the price at least on the tacos.  Trois Amigos is giving them away for $0.67 on their sale day (every Sunday or Wednesday... I forget which one).  I see that the owner/manager has responded to previous Yelp reviews where the reviewer cited price as an issue.  The owner responds about competition and staying in business but, honestly, I don't know anyone charging $3.50 for a cup of soda pop / soft drink.  My suggestion here is to review the competition and adjust prices accordingly.\n\n-- the service.  I read other people's reviews of this place and another Yelper \n(Raluca D.) commented on the service, too.  I can understand what he or she is referring to.  I'm not sure if I'd quite describe the staff as \"rude\" so much as too \"testosterone pumped.\"  There seemed to be some drive to be harsh and cool at the same time.  I'm referring to both speech and body language.  I didn't get one smile out of a single staff member.  I can't quite state it clearly perhaps, but the end result was an alienated customer.  The staff was distant and not at all friendly.  I don't know about you, but when I go to a place I'm looking for friendly staff when I'm forking over my hard-earned cash.  My advice would be for the Burrito Shop to hire a customer service consultant for a few hours to meet with its staff and give them some training on how to be friendlier.\n\n-- the cleanliness / d\u00e9cor.  Nope.  Didn't work for me.  The first problem was the seat  we pulled out at the table.  It hadn't been cleaned.  Three other tables still had trays with wrappers on them from previous clients (and no, the clients hadn't just left--I'd been in line long enough to see the tables were not being cleaned).  As for the d\u00e9cor, it's like the place was leased out on a low budget (which is fine for a startup place) but, on the other hand, they're almost trying to make themselves look like a chain.  Now, I absolutely hate M4 (because of the nonchalant staff and how cheap they are on the ingredient choices--nope, can't have 4, just 2), but at least M4 has a nice clean look and they succeed at going for that chain store look.   My advice would be for the Burrito Shop to ditch the attempt at going for the chain store look and go for something a little more unique and personal.  It'd be cool to see some \"authentic\" d\u00e9cor (I'll let you decide on what that could mean) or even wallpaper with pictures of places in Mexico or San Francisco (etc.).

The tomato salsa was served warm, and had bay leaf and celery in it - a flavor combo I've never had in Mexico, but one which really worked. We also bought some salsa to take home. We had beef tacos and tacos al pastor. The beef tacos were pretty good, but too much char on the meat, and the overall flavor was bland. The tacos al pastor were just as they should have been though, nicely cooked meat and great tang from the pineapple. Big marks also for serving everything with soft corn tortillas.

Indians who would choose to eat out over eating at home?? Dang, this place must be good.\n\nSana was recommended to me by \"Bob,\" a Pakistani green grocer who's a bit of a legend on the city's Parc Avenue. Basically, locals know to trust his wise opinion, me included. When I go out for Indian, my expectations are usually low because the best Indian food is home-cooked. For a cuisine that is traditionally healthy and flavorful, even the recommended Indian restaurants are often junk food style'y, cutting corners wherever they can i.e.) substituting oil for butter, reducing cooking time, sacrificing flavor for portion size, etc. But Sana is home-cookery at its best: simple recipes, made with fresh ingredients. \n\nThe pakoras and samosas have the right ratio of potato to herbs and spice. I always get the dahl - perfect for sharing. The saag-paneer is the bomb - I recommend having it with naan rather than rice. The naan isn't as quite pillowy-thick and chewy as it often is elsewhere, so you're able to eat more of it without getting full too fast. I usually don't do butter chicken but Sana's is cooked just right. The only dish I don't love is the biryani - it's a tad bit on the bland side. Order a side of raiita (yogurt with cucumber) to cleanse the palette. The mango lassi's good; the chai tea isn't robust enough (but that may be a regional way of brewing it), and the gulab juman and  barfi dessert are yummy town if you don't mind embracing cavities!\n\nPeople complain about the service, but I come here for an awesome meal under $10, not affection.

We both love Italian and figured this might be a nice alternative to the French bistro leaning environs. The crowd at this indoor-outdoor restaurant was all the convincing we needed.  Sunday we dined at a seafood Bistro which was lovely, Monday at Bis.  In a word, spectacular. My wife craves good veal and loves truffles, so she opted for the veal in truffle cream sauce..  To quote her, it was \"orgasmic, and the best dinner shed'd had in years\". She raved all night, including to the owner Aldo, who graced our outside table with several visits to chat. My pasta di mare was loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp and a whole split Maine Lobster served over al dente angel hair  pasta in a light red sauce,, equally spectacular. Desert of profiteroles, and ice cream served avogato (expresso slowly drizzled over a scoop) was all perecto!  Dinner was so good we have canceled a fancy restaurant reservation and will return later in the week so ny Mrs.  can have her veal again not withstanding so many other wonderful sounding items on the menu. Stay tuned for the the update, although we fear not.  Upon our return to our hotel, the Concierge asked how it was and advised many other recent diners had also raved."]}}, "-XUMQ8i1DFLahHSfbev10A": {"reviews": {"2": ["This restaurant markets itself as Tibetan-Indian, and it's an interesting concept, but in reality I found the food fairly bland and uninspiring.\n\nWe got the Butter tofu, a plate of momos and a dal soup and none of the dishes really stood out. The ingredients did not taste fresh and overall it did not feel worth the money. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night, or the dishes we ordered weren't their specialties, but I, for one, was not, impressed. There is better Tibetan and better Indian food to be had in Montreal.", "Let's start with the good: their house white wine is surprisingly good, by any means not an amazing wine but the type of wine I would reorder again because it's fresh, good and cheap. Now, I had an amazing experience in Vancouver trying vegetarian food in a Tibetan restaurant and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. Not sure if the previous reviewers tried the vegetarian meals, but we thought they were bland. After trying amazing dumplings in Vancouver and my mom's pierogies, my boyfriend and I were disappointed with their vegetarian dumplings. The dumplings: the dough was good, but they mixed potatoes and other veggies together, creating a paste without much flavour, like they put everything in the same blender and cooked it thereafter. The pakoras' dough was sweet - not my favourite. The vegetarian cari lacked the freshness of the spices, you couldn't taste the flavours. Finally, instead of a naan bread they had a piece of a round bread I had already bought in a grocery. Just call it whatever, not naan bread. Otherwise, the mango and green tea ice creams were okay, but nothing to go crazy about. You guessed it: I wouldn't come back.", "As a big fan of Tibetan food, I was expecting a fine gastronomic experience coming to this restaurant, but I left unimpressed. The folks who own the place are extremely courteous, but the vegetarian tofu dishes we ordered were dull as dishwater. We were looking forward to having their momos, but they turned out to be overly starchy. Made with more dough than actual filling.

But oh, the noodle is fresh and handmade, with a satisfying texture and consistency; the soup is a nice rich broth with spinach to make you feel even more virtuous.  I ask for some extra spice to, which gives it a good kick and clears away anything ick that may be in the sinuses!\n\nAlso, really like the friendly folks who run the place.  It's low-key, very reasonable prices and pretty good food all around.", "Getting to try Tibean food at Om was a treat so we ordered from the Tibetan part of the menu and skipped the Indian food.  The menu offers several kinds of dumplings (taste better than the word sounds) and realizing it was our first time, our server offered to bring a mixed platter of several kinds which was terrific.  The stir-fried beef with mushrooms was awesome.  Lentil soup was tasty but a bit thin to me.  Slow paces, but that was fine for us.", "Great service! The owner was very nice, and even recommended other restaurants to me to visit during my stay in Montreal. Definitely recommend the Momo dumplings!"], "5": ["Simply the BEST lentil soup I've EVER had!The mo mos were simply delish as well; especially the beef with tamarind dipping sauce...YUM!

We will be back next time we are visiting Montreal.", "This place is an absolute DELIGHT. Such warm + welcoming service - pure charm, all good vibes. The food was completely delicious. We had the blue cheese and lamb soup with naan bread as a starter, which was perfection. Then, a sampler of all the different types of momos (dumplings) which were artfully prepared, perfectly seasoned and came with the best mint sauce of life, I kid you not. We also had the chili chicken, which was also really, really tasty. \nTo top it all off, the prices are totally affordable. The wine selection leaves much to be desired, though, so next time I'll just stick with the super fresh mango lassie or the butter tea.

The wine paring is a joke, it is basically whatever wine they offer by glass. \n\nMy gf ordered the duck breast, overcooked.\n\nThe service is not bad, but again just average.", "Argh, what a disappointment.  Having read through the list of raving reviews and listening to the concierge's recommendations, I thought that this would be the killer place to spend our last evening in Montreal.  Instead, it killed the good vibe!  \n\nOk, so we sat down ok and had a nice introduction to the restaurant.  Staff was pleasant enough.  A bit disengaged but not to a degree that was unbearable.  I started with a lovely butternut squash bisque.  That was quite good.  The wife had a mesculun salad that had a grotesque, sloppy presentation (a large bunch of leaves bound together in a completely inconvenient mass too difficult to truly address) ... That had to be sent back.  She had a mushroom risotto that was quite nice.  I had a veal dish that was forgettable, to be honest.  She had a 'Pinot noir' that was, at best, a top choice at Olive Garden.  I had a cab that, without exaggeration, smelled like hard boiled eggs. To top if off, something caught fire in the kitchen, so service came to a stan still for the entire place.  The entire restaurant had a haze to it.  No apologies from management for the smell or for the fact that dinner took two hours.", "Overpriced and not even that good. We were gravely disappointed. Highly unrecommended!!!"], "3": ["Looks better than it tastes...\n\nThe attention to detail is excellent. But it's one of those experiences, where you feel bad eating it because you have to ruin the presentation. The restaurant itself is cozy and unpretentious, and doubles as a market and deli (interesting oil selections).  As far as the taste, I wasn't too thrilled. Amuse-bouche was a nice touch, but it came as a cheese that was way too salty. Good thing there was a gallon of water on the table to quench my salted mouth. The seared tuna I ordered was ridiculously chewy, and I was definitely not amused.\n\nTips: Should have got the pre fixe, but it was out of my budget!", "Chez L'epicier has a classy decor and menu, but I find the food to be artsy to the point of not really being food anymore. If you want to look at the food and not eat it you will really like this place.\n\nThe price structure is staggered so you can spend anywhere from $20 to $80 on your entree depending how fancy you want to get. The seven-course tasting menu is at the top of the tree. One problem with the tasting menu is that if others in your party are getting single-dish entrees they will be waiting around when you are on the various courses.\n\nThe wine list is phenomenal. You want to spend $2000 on wine? You came to the right place. Many of the wines are elite French vintages rarely seen outside of Europe. The lower end wines are around $100 a bottle and there are numerous grand cru options at around $400-$500. Only bottles are offered, no glasses of wine.\n\nI liked the laid back elegance of decor with a touch of rusticism. It is the perfect fit for feel of Montreal. They have shelves where you can buy various sauces and condiments in the foyer area.\n\nThe real problem with the restaurant is that the chef is an artist, not a cook. For example, when I got the tasting menu the final (seventh) course was a piece of lamb about the size of my thumb perched on top of a log cabin tower of vegetables I did not recognize. Over this aedifice was poured a semi-sweet chocolate sauce. The foundation of the quixotic structure was a bed of fluffed potatoes embued with a sauce of some sort. In general, every dish had to be explained by the server so you would know what it was.\n\nI don't really fault the restaurant for doing this kind of preparation, because unfortunately the trend in Quebec now is \"avante-garde\" creations which emphasize visual appearance. Hopefully this fad will go away soon. I mean, for the love of god, I go to museums if I want to look at art, and I go to restaurants when I want to eat.", "Not bad at all but somewhat overrated based on my personal experience there. $63 seemed excessive for 3 kir royals that our party ordered\nApps were fair. The ceviche seemed likely mostly veggies and little tuna. \n\nEntrees were good but lacked flair. \nMale server pleasant but lacking any warmth or enthusiasm. \nFemale who brought our dishes and described the preparations was warm,pleasant, and informative. \n\nNothing wrong with this meal but it was by far our most expensive in Montreal and it really was not memorable in any way."], "4": ["We ate here in December of last year and I can't recall exactly what we ate. I do recall that the food was super tasty and very well prepared. The restaurant is pretty stylish, but laid back and not too pretentious. When we ate, it was mostly a business crowd, but as we were enjoying a romantic evening meal they let us sit at the other side, near the bar. We were totally alone, and had a great time. I think I drunk too much....", "Maybe 4.5 stars. Went here for lunch. I had the penne with pesto and cherry tomatoes, which was very good. Also had a good green salad. Hubby had a wonderful cheesy squash soup that I ended up stealing, then the cod wrapped in ham with salted walnut butter, which was delicate and complex and really good. Service was excellent. This is just a nice little restaurant, with good cooking and high-quality ingredients. The food is fancy but the place is casual. You can't go wrong here.", "Great Restaurant.  My sister and I saw this place during the day and decided to go at night.  We looked up reviews and it seemed great.  My sister is a pastry chef and loves French food, so it was a good choice.  We got the halibut and the filet mignon.  Both were delicious as was my pre-main course salad.  Dessert is always the tell-tale sign of whether we like a restaurant and we were fairly pleased.\nFavorite: Caramelized nuts iced souffl\u00e9 with Frangelico, grilled pineapple, mango-coconut sauce, fennel madeleine.  It didn't even need the madeleine, the souffle was very creative and just so delicious.\nGood: Chocolate and textures.  It was good, because you always need a little chocolate but the souffle dessert was the best.\n\nAll in all we had a great dinner.  The atmosphere was cute and it was delicious.  The only negative thing I would say was that the service (for us) was a little lacking.  Being 20-somethings I felt like they didn't take us seriously and tended to other guests just a tad better.  Our server was very nice, but we waited a while at times.  \n\nI highly recommend it.  Would be a great date place!"], "5": ["This place was amazing.  My wife and I were walking around Old Montreal and we noticed two restaurants, Version and Chez L'Epicier.  After hitting the web on my phone we realized that they were both owned by Laurent Godbout.  So when we got back to our hotel, we asked the concierge about both of them.  She responded that Chez L'Epicier is more traditional French so we went with that one.  \n\nWhen we got there our table was not ready so we had a drink at the bar.  Once our table was ready we ordered a glass of champagne and got down to business.  My wife ordered the \"Homemade smoked salmon, gribiche sauce with lobster oil, fennel waffle and thickened vodka and black pepper cream\".  I must say that this might be once of the best appetizers I have ever eaten.  It was simply amazing.  I ordered the \"White asparagus velvety soup,  porcini and truffle oil,\nmushroom mousse, shallot chips\".  The soup was also amazing with the mushroom mousse out of this world.  For our main course my wife got the vegetarian option since she didn't want to have salmon for her appetizer as well as her main.  So she ordered the \"Confit tomatoes arancini, cepes mushrooms pur\u00e9e, boiler onions gratin,  gyromithe mushrooms.  Now, last year we were strict vegetarians for a whole year and I don't think we can say that we had one meal that tasted as good as this one.  The risotto was fried into a cake and accompanied by some great tasting vegetables.  I on the other hand ordered the lobster (didn't have on the menu so I can't post actual description).  This was probably the best lobster I have ever had.  The tail was infused with some injection of wonderful goodness and then it was accompanied by two claws with each one having a poached quail egg on top.  Under each claw there was a potato of some sort that was to die for.  For dessert we split the \"Medley of cr\u00e8mes br\u00fbl\u00e9es\".  There was Pistachio, Coffee, Honey, and Chocolate flavors.  \n\nNow when you walk into the restaurant you will see almost a little store.  There are amazing little gourmet items that you can purchase.  For instance, you can get truffle oils or even homemade marshmallows.  But the one thing that caught my eye was Laurent Godbout's cook book.  So after dinner I asked our waiter if Chef Godbout was actually there that evening which he was and I asked him if I could get the cook book signed.  So after a few minutes the waiter came back to my table, asked me my name and was off again.  A minute later he came back from the kitchen with the cook book autographed by Laurent Godbout.  It was a great ending to a great evening with my wife out in Old Montreal.", "On a visit to Montreal, my wife and I had an amazing time here.

I felt kind of bad asking but I asked for an extra dash of whatever vegetables they had and it was no problem! The gnocchi were a good deal firmer that I would have liked and the sauce had some good spice at first bite. I don't know if I just got used to it very quickly or what but I stopped noticing shortly after. Maybe not so spicy after all? \n\nThe server was very diligent serving our table of ten at the beginning. I must mention, I have quite a boisterous family and as the night went on I saw the server's patience wane.

I LOVE cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e. This one came in a wide and shallow dish that looked so inviting, I squealed.

Also, there was no pizza which is one of the signature dishes. The service was very slow. \nThe second experience was even worse. The service was slow and bad. We were the first to be in the restaurant and were the last to get our food. The food came cold. The ambiance was weird, from well-known symphonies to radio station music and shows. It sounded like we were in the gas station across the street. There are some good dishes but it wasn't worth the bad service and weird ambiance. \nFinally, this restaurant is defiantly overpriced.", "This restaurant was picked as a plan b, since we had difficulty finding a restaurant that would take in a group of 20. We were presented a table d'h\u00f4te at 35$. I believe the choices were two different pasta dishes(one in rose the other a type of alfredo sauce), a porcini mushroom pizza, a veal marsala and a risotto. I can't speak for the rest of the dishes, since I don't know of anyone at our table ordering them, but I can relate my own experience and that of the diners at my section of the table. Basically, generic, bland and overpriced. The cut focaccia flatbread with grated parmesan was good, but it's bread. The bruscetta was already soggy when we received it, but the flavors were well balanced enough to make it edible. Our chef's salad was soggy mixed greens with a wedge of tomato that did not look healthy (being winter in Montreal, I guess we get what we can). The real disappointment of the evening came with the mains. Between being served our salads (a good 45 minutes into our meal), I waited between 25 and 30 minutes for my main. I ordered the veal marsala. Seeing as I had waited this long for my plate,  I checked the temperature of the veal and found it to vary between an acceptable temperature to \"this is getting cold\". I have had veal marsala in many restaurants, and can even make a decent version of it myself. This was not veal marsala! I would call it \"veal in brown sauce\", as undepronounced as the flavors were. The veal was accompanied by three tiny wrinkled potatoes, a couple of slices of roasted yellow pepper, a slice of roasted eggplant and a balsamic coulis. Despite the mediocrity of my main, I feel I came out on top, because I saw the risotto. A few diners at our table had ordered it, expecting what you would expect, a nice flavorful risotto with a nice creamy texture. This, however, was described as \"mushy, bland, cream-of-wheat-ish\". From my perspective, it didn't look as if they had used arborio rice, or had used it it, but ignored the dish while it was cooking. I didn't ask to try it, so I went by the testimonial of my friend that it was not good. We ended with a coffee and a slither of a cheesecake with a couple of berries in the plate. Thoroughly disappointing to \"I'm never coming here again\" was the range of opinions about the meal. Regarding the service, everything was fine until the mains, but I think they were dealing with an out of control kitchen. Then everything just got slow and no waiter can to our table for a good 15 minutes (we were 20!). Finally, I do not like an in-bill service charge. I would like to be able to determine the tip for my meal myself, although I know that I would have probably given the same tip. Not because the service was great (it was adequate at best, and not very warm), but because I felt sorry for any waiter who chose to work in such a mediocre and pretentiously overpriced restaurant where, just because you use Italian naming in your menu, doesn't make it delicious or authentic by default. One tip for the chef (re: sous chef, re: cook), marsala sauce is supposed to have notes of actual marsala wine."], "3": ["This restaurant has really good food! Had the risotto and it was delicious.

And I liked it because it was nothing like you get back in the states. my wife gave her vedgie pizza a 3.5 stars. My daughter gave her plain cheese 4 stars.

Restaurant seating, at least for dinner, is downstairs though I suppose you could opt for the bar stools in the window if being on display is your thing. \n\nThey really nailed the menu with a dinner set for two that includes one soup, one salad, an appetizer, and a small portion of three different mains for about $45 with tips and taxes.  We were worried that there wouldn't be enough food, it turned out to be more food than we could finish.\n\nThe tortilla soup got us off to a rough start, I'm not an expert, but the thick and crunchy tortilla chips were taking a tepid bath in some tomato based dish water.  The mango salad came with a great portion of fresh greens and was loaded with semi-defrosted mangoes straight from Costco. Next up were some little beef taquitos served with a nice creamy guacamole.\n\nThe main course arrived on a tray with three bowls, one of chicken mole, one of spicy beef, and bowl of guacamole shrimp.  After a short wait the waiter did bring us a scoop of rice and a small stack of tortillas.  The mains were great.  The mole was rich but maybe a touch too sweet, the beef was tender and spicy, and they didn't skimp on the shrimp.  Sadly they nuked the tortilla shells just before serving them. \n\nI liked the concept and some of the food, but so disappointed that they cut corners.  I want to like this place and I want to go back but the watery soup, frozen mangoes, and nuked tortillas really make it hard for me to justify a meal that costs more than $20 per person.", "Nice restaurant, if only they paid more attention. My cactus salad... came as the mango salad, which had mango so cold that it was almost frozen. It was one of two mishaps because the waiter was just not paying enough attention to the order. \n\nOn the other hand the food was quite tasty (except that mango) and they certainly served up more than enough food.

The waitresses methodically opened bottles while describing the menu items. The small staff of 3 worked the room with precision and pleasantries. \n\nThe food was new French with many of seasonal and local ingredients, but prepared with a freshness leaving some of the richness of traditional French food behind. \n\nI had zuchinni flowers stuffed with mushrooms served over a bed of sweet peppers drizzled with a red pepper sauce.

(a small portion of potatos gratin was so cheesy that the cheese took over the flavor of anything else with it).\n\nMy husband had ceviche for his entree followed by a filet mignon which he found to be cooked perfectly, but a bit rich for his taste. His meal was served with the same host of side dishes. \n\nThere was a nice surprise - a palate cleansing course of melon sorbet served in a martini glass splashed with vodka. MMM!\n\nThe place had a good energy. We would go again!", "This is not a tiny place, it seats 30 people easily. It is open and airy, the restrooms and kitchen are in the basement, further contributing to a sense of openness and space. There is a one page menu featuring the standard French fare. There was an effort to use unique ingredients such as fiddleheads (in the middle of May?) and sea urchin, as well as cheese and beef from PEI. Bring your own bottles of wine.\n\nFood: The food is above average. I ordered the octopus appetizer. It was grilled perfectly and presented beautifully on the plate. The entre I ordered was bison ribs. I had to send it back to the kitchen. The brick-heavy lump I was presented with was a tough hunk of meat. Like chewing a baseball. I complained that it was overcooked but the waitress corrected me to say it was actually not cooked long enough. Either way, it was inedible so they graciously replaced it with the duck which was perfect. For dessert I tried both the chocolate torte and creme brule. The chocolate was not too sweet and I would recommend this dish.\nService: Our waitress frequently rolled her eyes at customers within our view when other tables asked questions about the menu, or made requests. My dinner companion reminded her of a forgotten order which resulted in more eye rolling. I felt this disdain of customer requests and questions was not acceptable or appropriate.\nPricing: Generally a good value. The menu items are priced well at approx $15 for appetizers, $29 for entres. I tipped 15% but as we were leaving, the waitress pulled me aside from my group and implored me to give her a higher tip. I interpreted this to mean she wanted me to include the undercooked entre returned to the kitchen. Being flustered and non confrontational, I paid for both entres.\nAmbiance: One of the best things about this restaurant is the openness of the space. It is clean, modern, and simple with plenty of natural light.", "We decided to eat here based on the Yelp & UrbanSpoon reviews. While I thought the food was very good, I don't consider it the most memorable meal and the wait between our appetizer and entree was unacceptable. Probably 45 minutes and the waiter never checked on us and seemed oblivious to the fact that our meal had not arrived. The scallop ceviche appetizer was lovely, summery, light and balanced.  My daughter loved her salmon fumee with couscous and seaweed butter. I thought my husband's fish special with lobster bisque, sweet peas & wheat berries was the best dish of the evening. While my duck with celeriac, beets & lemon-thyme sauce was nice, it was similar to many dishes I've had elsewhere. As I said earlier, the entire evening was marred for me by the long wait. I think they are understaffed with the servers washing dishes, slicing bread & refilling water on top of running downstairs to fetch the food."], "4": ["The host at our B&B recommended this place for a modern take on French cuisine.  He tried to explain how the name \"O'Thym\" is a play on words, but I don't remember how that worked out...

I can't really speak as to the quality of traditional French food, but it tasted real good, looked real good, and we felt real good sitting in the space.\n\nAs tourists in the city, it is a safe bet that this place will set the mood for a wonderful evening in Montreal.\n\nWe'll go back.", "I was looking for a good bistro near the B&B i was staying at (Le Simone) and the reviews on this place, though only two, seemed quite good. I tried to walk in and get a table Saturday evening but it was booked up so set a reservation for Monday night. As with many places in the area of Montreal where I was staying it was BYOB but not too hard to find a Couche-Tard close by to get a few bottles of wine.\n\nThe place has a great atmosphere and the night I went it was  raining and my group was by the window. Being from Arizona I am absolutely fascinated by seeing rain so for me, a great spot, but it is a long restaurant and I am sure if asked one could get a table toward the back.\n\nAll the food my group of four ordered was delicious. One person ordered the salad with saut\u00e9ed  duck gizzards and they were melt in your mouth tender. I had to try the foi gras (might have spelled that wrong which on this night was served room temperature and mixed with a bit of honey that gave it a slightly sweet texture (the other option is the more usual saut\u00e9ed version).  I was on a duck roll that evening and also had the grilled duck breast that was served (correctly) quite rare and sliced thin and then fanned out. Two other people at the  table had the salmon and thought it was well done.\n\nI liked this place enough that when I go back to Montreal I plan on a return visit. It has that classic bistro feel that makes you feel that you could just as well be in Paris as Montreal (viva la France!). I promise you, if you go, you will not be disappointed! :-)", "Definitely the best BYOB French you can get in the city.\n\nI had the veal sweetbreads and they were amazing.  The other 4 diners at my table agreed.  The salmon tartar was good, too.    For the entr\u00e9es, I would recommend trying the sweetbreads!  Having tried lots of different things, but not a huge fan of organs, I was really surprised.  Sooo good!\n\nAs for the mains, the bison is very good as is the newly-added duck-confit leg with barley risotto.  Unanimous around the table as a great main. \n\nI would recommend the second service as there is little pressure at that time to leave the table.  That being said, the service is not very fast, however the staff is very nice and knowledgeable.\n\nFor your BYOB needs consider paying about $10 more for your main to have great food.\n\nWill return.\n\nOne sad note is their website needs a makeover.  Just a detail."], "5": ["Montreal is over-saturated with French bistros. Seemingly hidden on every side street and kitty-corner, they should be approached with caution. I generally pause to parse over the menus and maybe glance at the laminated reviews in the window as I walk by them. No more than that. Most are pricey and I'd say they aren't worth it but I haven't eaten at enough of them to make that judgment. But on my modest income, limited budget (if I ever bothered to sort one out) and meager debt-ridden existence, if I'm going to go out and spend 50 hard-earned dollars on a meal, it better be worth it.  There's nothing worse than a disappointing and expensive meal. Okay, there's a lot worse than a disappointing over-priced meal (like cancer) but you know what I mean.  \n\nThis brings me O Thym, a bistro that stands out amid this cluttered market. First things off the bat - it's BYOW. This already makes the price of a meal that much more reasonable since wine can tack on at least a dollar sign or two to any meal (and who wants to eat at a French bistro without a bottle of wine? It's like eating corn on the cob without butter. And it's even better when you can bring two or three bottles and feel extra extravagant without paying forty bucks a bottle). But, yeah, there are other French bistros that are BYO (specifically on the Plateau which has about six of them that I can name off the top of my head) so this plus has to be backed up by the food. And this unassuming bistro off of de Maisonneuve in the Village is the best BYO bistro I've been to (better than Au Petit Plateau, Colombe and a few others I forget) . The decor is minimalist and tasteful (it actually doesn't look like much from the outside - could be a fancy sandwich joint) with a daily menu chalked on a large blackboard. Prices are fairly reasonable considering it's French and BYO (something like 22 to 35 for main courses). I had the best ostrich I've ever had in my life there.  Sure, that may not say too much since I've only had ostrich a handful of times in my life but this one was cooked to absolute perfection. Great food, good unpretentious service and the bill only worked out to forty per person with an appetizer and main course (including tax and tip).", "What a way to start off my visit to Montreal! Delicious.\n\nI called and made a reservation for two 45 minutes prior to our arrival to allow for enough time to stop by the SAQ and pick up some wine - BYOW, what a great way to dine! Buying wine at the liquor store we were able to drink VERY well - Chateau Margaux and Chateauneuff du Pape!! Must have saved over $100 compared to buying those wines in a restaurant.\n\nOn our way to the restaurant, my sister called and asked to join us, and O Thym accommodated no problem: we had to wait 15 minutes for a table for three to open up, but our waiter was happy to seat us and open one of our bottles while we waited for my sister to arrive and switch to the other table. Being Ville Marie (or The Village, depending on who you talk to) it is nearly all Francophone. The menu was chalked up on a board entirely in French, a lovely characteristic, but our waiter was happy to bring us an English menu - not even of a flutter of snobbery. Throughout the meal he made a much-appreciated effort to speak to us in English, and did a bang-up job at it, topping off our fabulous experience.\n\nNow, to the food! Oh the food - scrumptious. I started with the sweetbreads while my fellow diners had the smoked duck salad and the salmon & avocado tartare. Forkfuls exchanged around the table, all quite tasty. We followed that with a palate cleanser of sorbet, and then I had the venison and the rest of the table the filet mignon. Once again, all delectable. For dessert we shared a cheese plate, the creme brulee, and the flourless chocolate cake. No let down here either! The meal was paced perfectly, and we were the last ones in the place.\n\nComing away from a meal like that without having broken the bank was just so refreshing. The BYOW along with mouth-watering food and top-notch service all in an unpretentious setting: this is bistro dining at its best!", "I'll write a full review on one of the other listings for this restaurant, so be sure to check it out. \nThis place is divine.

Don't worry if you don't understand Italian, or if you're having trouble reading the handwriting; your waiter will explain every item on the menu in great detail.\n\nYou must realize that the restaurant caters to providing a 'dining atmosphere' rather than an 'eat and run' atmosphere. I make a point to say this, because I've read other reviews of this restaurant on other sites, (I'm surprised I'm the first one Yelping it) where people had complained about slow service. The service is not slow; the waiters are simply giving you time to talk amongst yourselves - something that we don't do enough of anymore.\n\nThe restaurant is ridiculously close to the Jean Talon market, and the waiter did tell me that the menu can change seasonly, depending on what's available at the market.\n\nThat being said, this restaurant is apparently famous for their Risotto. Personally, I've never been a fan of Risotto, but the people I was there with did say that it was among the best they've ever tried.\n\nThey have some very interesting items on the menu - this is not your typical Americanized Italian restaurant. Depending on what you order, some of the portions are small, but I wasn't hungry when I left. I had very good lobster ravioli as an appetizer, followed by lamb chops for my main course. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly.\n\nI got to sample (from one of the people I was with) the calamari and shrimp in a tomato broth, which was good, but I would've gotten sick of the tomato taste had I ordered it as my appetizer. I also sampled the lobster, again, served in a tomato broth. Again, good, but I would prefer it without the broth. One thing though; they say they use 1 to 1 & 3/4 lbs lobsters for that dish, but trust me, it seemed smaller.\n\nFor dessert we shared the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake with espresso sauce. They were both good, but I would go with the lava cake over the tiramisu next time.\n\nIt's not a very large venue, but it did fill up by 8:30/9:00 on a Saturday night, so I would recommend reservations. All in all, a very nice experience, and I would go back.", "Delicious meal. Duck meatball starter was delicious as was the zucchini blossom stuffed with ricotta. The side of pasta with meat ragout was very good. You can't go wrong with fresh pasta. Main was a shared rib steak. Delicious with nice sides.

Simply exquisite!!! Plus my friend was treating since she hit the jackpot at the casino :) \n\nFor entr\u00e9e we had the fried calamari and smoked salmon. The fried calamari's batter was soft and slightly salty and the meat was fresh and tender, it was served with a wedge of lemon and home made mayo. This will hit the spot if you like fried calamari. The salmon was fresh and tender, it was accompanied with pickled red onions and thin slices of olives. Hints of salty and sour on a canvas of fresh lightly cured salmon nice balance which complemented well with the calamari. \n\nThen we had 3 pasta dishes for our mains and skipped the secondo course and opted for dessert instead. The table next to us ordered the short rib main dish and it looked delish but sadly our appetite was not with us, maybe next time. \n\nWe had the linguine with lobster and ros\u00e9 sauce, the risotto with porcini mushroom and white truffle oil and gnocchi wit four cheese. \n\nThe risotto was very fragrant, never thought mushroom had much flavor but in this dish it was very apparent, you could smell the porcini and truffle throughout, and the rice was cooked to perfection soft but not mushy, yum, by far the best risotto I've ever had! \n\nThe lobster linguine with ros\u00e9 sauce was just as good. The pasta was fresh and tender without being mushy, it soaked up the sauce very well, so tasty I was already sad after the first bite cuz I knew I would crave this again the next day. \n\nThe gnocchi was full of cheese a little overwhelming for my taste but if you like cheese I strongly recommend it. The texture is very soft and melts in your mouth. \n\nFor dessert we had the tiramisu and the profiteroles. The tiramisu was soft and melts in your mouth, with strong coffee flavor it was perfect and hit the spot. The profiteroles were crazy food. The shells were soft they were not hard even when served with ice cream, it was refreshing and drizzled with chocolate sauce yum! \n\nBest of all we just walked in with no RSVP and we were seated right away!!! \n\nGreat place, will be coming here often, the pasta here is really top notch.

I was tempted to try the Germaniinspired special, with sauerkraut, red onions, and I believe sausage, but instead I went for the pizza Diavolo.  It was surprisingly spicy and flavorful. The crust is particularly good--quite crisp with a hint of Parmesan baked into it. They have a number of decent Italian and Californian wines by the class. \n\nI asked the waiter's recommendation among several very tempting dessert options and followed his guidance in ordering the Praline royale.

Not exactly as we prefer. 2.75/5\n\n2) Beef Pad Sew- From what I have experienced Pad Sew is typically in a soy sauce base. This pad sew was more like stir fry. It wasn't horrible but I would not consider the flavour and taste as memorable. 3/5\n\n3) Cha Kneiy Chicken (Ginger Stir Fry)- similar to other Ginger based stir fry's I've had at other Cambodian restaurants.

That's a lot for orange sauce mac & cheese, no matter how good it is.\n\nMy husband had a burger with swiss; though the meat was dry, the buttery bun was sufficiently toasty and held up well to the weight of toppings without getting soggy. i like that it came with fries AND salad, so you don't have to go all Sophie's Choice between the two. \n\nTo sum up: it's good but not worth a special trip -- though I love the 40's diner-esque vibe of the decor.", "I would give it 2 1/2 really on food quality.  It's Montreal  I want tasty French food my friend checked tripadvisor instead of taking the concierge recommendations or checking YELP?!.  Boo!! Hiss! terrible! the waitress was ok nice, my pinot was smoking loon eh (what $10 bottle retail right)... This is just to give you an idea of what people here think is good.  I had the calamari eh... and a chicken salad I hadn't eaten all day and its 8pm I'm angry hungry and this was barely edible.  The bread is sustaining my spoiled butt until I find something better tomorrow!!!\n\nI didn't like my chicken salad because it seemed confused.  it was a guacamole salsa cold chicken breast salad with grapefruit.  I imagined a citrus dressing with the grapefruit but I think it was literally mayonaise?! not sure what you call mayo in French but I say NON!NON! no good. Go elsewere Montreal is known for restaurants right... Bonne chance!"], "4": ["What a great find!  Vallier is very well priced for the quality of the food and the service and was just a few blocks away from my hotel without being too tourist-y.  Before visiting, I was picturing a true diner-type atmosphere but was pleasantly surprised at  the chic interior - a little retro in keeping with the theme, but very sleek and elegant with tall windows and warm fixtures.\n\nThe menu has been very thoughtfully compiled and though it is relatively small, there is something for everyone - fantastic comfort food like steak tartare, duck shepherd's pie, macaroni and cheese with bacon - I had a difficult time choosing, but our server was very helpful in pointing us toward his favorite items and he was absolutely right!  I had scallops over parsnips and fennel with bacon and maple topped with asparagus - they were cooked just perfectly; I couldn't have asked for anything better.  I also tried the wild game meatloaf with porto foie gras... wow.  I'm also a fan of the fries with homemade mayo - OK, mostly the homemade mayo!\n\nAlong with a nice wine list, there are several good microbrews available and though I didn't make it all the way to dessert, there were some delicious offerings - I was very tempted by the chocolate maple pie (among several other things).  Vallier was really an excellent experience, and a much better value than many other restaurants in Old Montreal.", "For an American who has no idea what Canadian cuisine is (do Canadians really know what Canadian cuisine is?), Vallier did a nice job explaining it to me. Apparently, it consists of similar things as American comfort food (your meatloaf, your mac and cheese, etc), but with a northern twist.\n\nFor example, I had the meatloaf (or pain viande, if you must), but it was made of game. It was like eating a really big, juicy hamburger patty that happened to be spiced and had delicious pieces of bacon peppered within. Oh yes, and it was topped with a sliver of foie gras. Not exactly for the faint of artery or the humane. The side of vegetables was perfectly roasted. The carrots were so carrot-y! The asparagus asparagus-y! The tomatoes were sundried, yet somehow incredibly tender!\n\nFor dessert, my server Pascal (what a wonderful French name!) recommended the maple pudding, but fearing it might be Canadian overkill, I chose the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was not maple-flavored, but coffee-infused, and was topped with some round yellow thing that I thought was a tomato but wasn't a tomato at all. The mind boggles.\n\nAnyway, for an out-of-towner, Vallier was a great choice because the food seemed pretty authentic (rather than cheesily catering to poutine-craving tourists), and the price wasn't bad. Attentive service, too. The wine list could be a little more comprehensive (or more carefully selected) for the type of gastronomic experience the place strives to be; nevertheless, a fantastic find!", "I just can't get enough of their Nicoise Salad.

It exceeded all my expectations.  The macaroni and cheese was delicious and complex.  The gazpacho, satay marinated shrimp, rosemary cressini & roquette salad was so good, I almost wished it was meal sized.  \n\nThey also have local cider (cidre) available, and there was one called Perle which I liked better than most I have tried in Canada.  You don't find many tourists in Vallier, which is a nice change from the area it's in, and you can't go wrong with anything you pick out from the menu.", "Great food at a reasonable price!\n\nAmerican food with a french-twist. \nI think I had almost everything on the menu and I liked everything.

The wine list was not extensive but there was plenty to choose from to complement the meal. Wrapped it all up with a 375ml bottle of tawny port from Warres and a selection of fine Quebec cheeses. Couldn't ask for more. The decor is minimalist with the menu prominently displayed on a large blackboard which stimulated discussion around the table. There was also the option of a 7 course degustation menu which looked very interesting. There is a patio but, not surprising for a central restaurant, it is close to the road.

Having said that, it was nice sitting outside, the wine was good, service was good, and the food was good. Price was in-line with what you would expect. Certainly worth the visit. \n\nThey gave us bread, as much as we wanted, which is always good unless the bread is terrible. The bread wasn't terrible so that's a good thing. We also got a soup, a gazpacho I believe. It was good, especially with the free bread. I like bread. \n\nThe appetizer was the stuffed portobello with goat cheese. It was really good, regardless of the amount of bread they may or may not have given us. Of course as soon as it was gone I wanted more, but then we had the main dish that was coming next so it was ok.

It was almost a month ago now and it has long since slipped both of our minds. We both feel like it was some kind of beef, and it had a salad on the side.

But I assure you it was good, and if I lived across the street I would go there right now to prove a point. What point, I'm not sure. \n\nAnyway, from top to bottom the experience was solidly good and I would recommend it.

It was good. We got a Merlot from France and it was a tasty selection. It went well with the meal and we both enjoyed it. See? We do remember most of the meal. Just not the meat.

We then tried to order wine, they were out of our first 4 choices. We then ordered our meals, three people ordered salads and everyone ordered an entree. After we ordered we noticed that we had not received our scotch about 15 minutes later because there was no bartender, so finally one of the bus boys wandered over to the bar, filled 3 glasses to the brim with ice and started pouring Jack Daniels into the glasses, one member of our table saw this and went over to the bar to instruct them on which scotch they wanted and that traditionally it doesn't come in a glass entirely filled with ice.

Even when there is no one else in the restaurant, the waitresses take 10 min to get your bill and then swipe your card.\n\nThe desserts need working on as well, not much choice.\n\nI have always managed to see someone famous whenever I eat an early dinner here.\n\nOverall, its an ok spot to grab something to eat and have a decent pizza at a reasonable price.

ALL of the bartenders (there were 4) were pretty amazing, dancing and having the time of their lives. They were friendly, respectful and generous! I got some random free shots show up in front of me, just because the bartender wanted me to try out a new concoction he'd invented. Delicious!

Recently more smokehouses have cropped up, to my smokehousy glee. \n\nOne of them is the underrated and under-advertized Bofinger Authentic American BBQ. Which I didn't know even existed until a few months ago. And they actually have more than one storefront. Why did no one tell me of this earlier?\n\nAnd they make some seriously good grub to.

These ribs are tender, tasty and taste like smoked ribs should and not mopped with tons sauce, just a slight touch of which there are plenty to chose from. I propose the Memphis sauce but that's up to you. The pulled pork sandwich is what pulled pork sandwiches are made of. The pork is freaking awesome, the slaw is crunchy and perfectly acidic and the bun, the holy good god what is this bun is perfectly balanced with the sandwich. Easily the best pulled pork I've had in Montreal. \nThen there's the sides, as earlier, the slaw is perfect, the Mac n Cheese (obligatory in southern cooking, if you don't have Mac n Cheese, you do not offer southern cooking) is exactly how I'd love to make it. Though the savoriness of the ribs, pork and slaw, might make the mac feel underwhelming but it's not, it's perfect. The potato salad, another southern staple, misses the mark by including olives. I've never met a southern potato salad with olives before and I hate olives with a passion so they were a disappointment. \n\nThey also have other goodies I'll be eating very soon, the pulled pork poutine (DUH!), they also serve an \"authentic cheesesteak sandwich\" and having lived in Philly, it better be damn good but I'm looking forward to trying that also even though it's not a southern sandwich. They have a brisket sandwich as well, wonder if I can just get the meat as a side.\n\nWhere's the corn? Tasty BBQ is only improved with a corncob either boiled or grilled. Sadly they have no corncobs on their menu. Also where's the sweet tea served in a Mason jar? And my single true point of contention is that the hot food is only warm at best.

It took forever to get a water refill, and when I asked for a jam aside from the 2 orange marmalades on the table, my server brought 2 jams from an adjoining table (those single size jars), and one of them was used.

My group of three came in fairly late, although not close enough to closing that we were the last guests.

The tuna tartare was quite delicious, but the risotto was mediocre at best, although given the amount of time it took for the dish to get to us I would have thought it was being prepared with great pomp and ceremony.  Maybe they were preparing our waitress' dinner instead, as I noticed her eating through the glass divider while we were left forlorn at our table.\n\nI put it plainly to the hotel's Resident Manager - I will always be a regular at the W Montreal, but unless things change I will never set foot in Otto again."], "3": ["Otto has its home in the W Hotel in Montreal, and despite the chic lobby, bar and restaurant, Otto, for the most part, delivers good food without frills.\n\nI've dined at the restaurant four times in four years, and since 2004, the kitchen has matured and the menu has freshened a couple of times (not counting seasonal shifts). Chef Nick D'Onofrio took over the kitchen in 2006, and since then, the restaurant shifted from a menu of Italian fusion, to something more traditional. \n\nThe core is now firmly Italian cuisine - respectable pastas, Osso Bucco, several fish dishes, rack of lamb. The starters are fine - tuna tartare, beef tartare, salads, tempura seafood.\n\nOne doesn't expect to be dazzled by hotel dining, and one can certainly note the higher prices typical of hotel restaurants, but Otto gives a reputable meal, with a wine list that represents France and Italy nicely, but features little in the way of California wines beyond commodity brands like Mondavi, Kendall Jackson, and Sebastiani. (You'll find this often in Montreal restaurants.)\n\nIf you're staying at the W Hotel or nearby, or you've had enough to drink in the cool W bar and you'd rather crawl a short distance to dinner (we appreciate both circumstances), you're more than likely to be pleased with the results.", "I think I have been spoiled by really good restuarant that just happen to be in hotels. When I go to a four or five star hotel I expect the restaurant to be of the same level. Otto unlike other W restaurant was pretty average. It's only be a week since I ate there and I can barely remember what entrees we had. There was only one vegetarian choice and while the portions were sized for americans, nothing was exceptional. \n\nThe desserts were expensive but very tasty, with interesting combos of flavours and textures.\n\nIf I had not been staying at the W I probably would not have gone to it but for the business meeting dinner we were having it was perfectly fine.\n\nThe bill was around 50 a person without drinks.", "I visited Otto with a big group of people for a friend's birthday and was pleasantly surprised.  Overall the service was relaxed and friendly.  They had no problems accommodating a large group and were patient with explaining various menu items to some of the people in our group with dietary restrictions.  The food itself was better than I expected.  Usually in glitzy places like this, the food looks good but is just alright at best.  But this was really tasty.  I had the homemade tagliatelle with meatballs and spare ribs.  While it was pricey, I easily could have split this dish with a dining companion and we would have both still been satisfied.  The desserts were equally good, well presented but also quite rich and decandant.\n\nThe decor is really special.  Lots of red, and unexpected textures.  It was the perfect backdrop for a birthday celebration (and lots of picture taking).\n\nWhile I will not be running back anytime soon, I will keep this one tucked up my sleeve for future special occasions."], "4": ["November 2012, staying at the W Hotel in Montreal.  Hungry.  Generally fearful of hotel restaurants.  Lazy.  Checked out Yelp to see what people had to say about Otto, in my hotel.  Horrible things.  Scared.  More lazy than scared - went to Otto.\n\nI could not have been more pleased.  I was away on business and traveling alone, so I oped to sit at the bar, located just to the side of the main entrance.  Great bar service, well prepared martini.  Relaxed and ready for dinner.  Started off my meal with a salad that consisted of baby wild arugula, caramelized figs, fresh ricotta, hazelnuts, with a  sage and honey vinaigrette.  For my entree I had the black cod, marinated daikon, black sesame seeds and pak-choi.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  \n\nI was able to get a late checkout a the hotel, and decided to have a late lunch prior to driving back to the states.  Upon walking into the restaurant, the hostess remembered my name, asked me how my night was, and where I wanted to sit - bar or table in the main dining room.  Nice to be remembered.  This time I opted for a table.  Great room, vaulted ceilings, huge windows looking out to the city.  Lunch was just as good as dinner the night before.  \n\nVery satisfied.", "The service & food are excellent!  I stayed at the hotel and since the forecast called for rain in the evening, I decided to stay in the hotel and eat at Otto. I read the reviews on yelp beforehand and wasn't sure what to expect. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I am somewhat of a food snob and I loved everything. The waiters were extremely attentive but not overly invasive. They always came to refill my water before it was completely empty.  Also, a big plus for me is that they left a large bottle of water on each table.  For others, this may not be a big deal but I drink alot of water and don't want to have to flag a waiter down just to refill my glass.  In this case, I would not have had to because the waiters at Otto were so attentive, but even if they weren't, I would have been able to refill my water as I pleased.  I did come on a Sunday evening and the restaurant had very few patrons at that time, but nevertheless, impeccable service. \n\nFood: Starter - scallops: Cooked perfectly!  So delicious. The dish also includes spinach, mushrooms, and pancetta. Delicious!!!\n\nMain Course-Seafood Linguine pasta. Again, very good. The highlight of my night were the scallops in the appetizer and the scallop in the main course. \n\nAmbiance: Very nice decor. Modern without trying too hard. Music was also very cool. It sounded like a mix of modern French, African, and funky lounge-y music. I enjoyed it. \n\nI really don't know why this place has such a low rating on yelp. Perhaps I lucked out by going on a slow night and picking the dishes I picked, but I would definitely come to Otto again and recommend it. Yes, it is pricey but it is on par with all of the other downtown/Old Montreal restaurants I have been to of this caliber. Honestly, all of the restaurants in this area are overpriced so how can anyone fault Otto for pricing comparably?  Just my opinion.", "I liked it a lot.  It's inside the \"W\" Hotel which is a bit fanatically over-cool, and it features a ridiculous amount of red neon, but the menu is good, the place is chic, and it's fun.  With my guests I tried a couple of dishes that are tricky to prepare, and the results were excellent.   Overall I thought the menu was very appealing although, as a person who doesn't eat meat the selection of options was not that large.  The food we ordered was very nicely prepared, plated, and quiet delicious with decent but to excessive portions.\n\nThe staff was quite friendly and helpful, although only so-so in terms of being attentive.  I think the owners must put a lot of emphasis on hiring very attractive staff, which is fine, but the youth of the staff comes at the expense of experience.  That's not a problem at a normal restaurant, but at a place with a good menu and substantial prices, a deeper familiarity with the wine list and menu might have been nice.  That said, I was very happy with the experience and have already been back once.\n\nThe place only seems to fill up later in the evening so arrive early if you want something very quiet where you own the place, or late if you want a scene that is packed."]}}, "0RsYRnk0z2Y_GbK7fB9nLQ": {"reviews": {"2": ["Tout un d\u00e9cor o\u00f9 on y viendrait bien tourner un film, mais pour la bouffe on repassera...

The sound system was a bit loud and we ended up having dinner outside in the front. It was raining but they have a canopy set up so that you have the option of sitting outside without getting wet. It was a Friday evening between 10 - midnight that we were there. We ordered the Osso Bucco over buttered spaghetti and the Steamed Mussels in Curry broth as our starter. We felt the portions were big enough to share which we were right. They also bring you out a fresh warm baguette to dip in pesto and Olive Oil. Overall, our experience was surprisingly pleasant and our bill with 1 main, 1 appetizer and two drinks totalled $50.

We started with the bruschetta, and there was plenty of warm carbs being placed on our table and a self-serve balsamic vinegar and olive oil to accompany it. My boss enjoyed her pasta dish, as well as I enjoyed my penne with garlic and veggies. The taste was very fresh, since I am not a huge pasta fan, but I really liked my dinner. The service was impeccable too. \nAfterwards, we enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar and the bartender was flirty, but nice and I could tell wanted to chit chat with us.

The last time I ate here, the food and service were so bad that I'll *never* go back.\n\nWe ordered two kinds of tacos, the pastors and the carnitas. The meat in both of them was *extremely* dry and none of the other ingredients were fresh. I suspect that they served us leftover meat from the day before. Neither of us finished our tacos. \n\nWe did *not* complain, but when our waitress asked how everything was, I explained that nothing was fresh. After speaking with the chef, she came back and explained that he said everything was fresh, so it must've been fresh.\n\nSubsequently, they offered us some complimentary churros. These too were too dry to finish.\n\nOn our way out, all three members of the kitchen staff gave us dirty looks.\n\nWhen spending $50 on tacos, I expect a lot more out of the food and service.", "I'm a big fan of Mexican food.

Tortilla soup was tasty but would have been much better if it were served hot - it arrived lukewarm.

Over the years I've had hard, soft, some were borderline pitas. This was soft, and small, no pun intended :P\n\nThe tortilla tore very easily, which made is very hard to eat. The fish tacos were the best. The fish was crispy, and the cole slaw added a nice touch. Second best was the pork pineapple, I'm a sucker for pineapple. It was a nice combo. \n\nall the tacos lacked a little salt, but I think the reason is because everything is served with 3 kind of salsa, all house made, one regular, one with green tomatillos and a hot spicy one. Even with the salsa it lacked salt for me.\n\nOverall I really liked this place and I wanna try the other tacos I didn't get to try.\n\nThe waitress was really nice, the wait for the tacos to come out could be a bit, but once it starts the service was very good.", "i had 3 different tacos, pescado''fish'' conchinita''pulled pork'' and bistec''beef''...all pretty good, the pulled pork was best, i just wish the menu was bigger theres missing something, but overall good, especialy the dulce de leche churros yum!", "I'd give it a solid three. The tortillas were not very well made and were falling into pieces at one point. Portions of the tacos were not enough for a hungry person and slightly on the pricy side IMHO. Tortas were better priced and tasted pretty good. Decor is simple but good."], "4": ["We selected this restaurant based on Hoang-Khai's very positive Yelp review and I'm so glad that we happened on this lovely family-owned restaurant in the western reaches of the Plateau. We dined there on a lively Friday night with a group of six and we all enjoyed the evening very much. \n\nWhen I lived in Montreal I didn't have kids and didn't give a thought to whether an establishment would be kid-friendly or not but now it's very much on my mind and to my delight, T&T is very kid-friendly while at the same time hospitable to adults and student-types alike. The back area is spacious and simple with long tables and bench-like seating around the exterior. \n\nThe menu is straightforward and simple - tortas (Mexican sandwiches), tacos, and churros. I like the simplicity but I would say that a few appetizers would be a welcome addition. We were a group catching up after a long time of not seeing each other and we wanted our meal to last longer than just one course. I would have liked to start with some house-made chips and salsa and drinks or sopes or something. As it was we ordered three tortas to share - the vegetarian, milanesa (breaded beef filet), and pulled pork. The two meat tortas were quite delectable - the bread was soft and sopped up garlicky sauces quite nicely. I would say that the pepper in the vegetable torta would taste great if roasted - I think it would make the sandwich easier to eat. \n\nOn to the tacos - there are four tacos in each order so I definitely recommend pairing up and sharing. We had the fish, carnitas (pork belly to me was a little dry here), and the al pastor, which I loved. The salty-sweet with the addition of the pineapple is so nice. \n\nDrinks for me were the very refreshing Paloma (I loved the addition of Aperol in this drink) and the Chelada - a bloody Caesar with Corona. Mojitos, limonada, and some other items were also available along with beer, so there is definitely a nice variation of items. \n\nChurros for dessert are a must - we tried the dulce de leche and the chocolate and they were both incredible. Hot out of the fryer and drizzled with sweetness. The bamboo boards and salsa service is quite lovely too. \n\nBig plus: house-made tortillas! Amazing! \n\nThis is a great discovery and I can't wait to return!", "During my vacation to Montreal, I was craving tacos.  As I Yelped possible places to try, I settled on T&T Tacos Et Tortas.  Boy, did I make a great choice! It is a small place that is away from the typical tourist spots in Montreal.  My first impression was a good one.  I really enjoyed the wait staff.  Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  She gave some great recommendations including a thumbs up to the fish tacos. I was reading about how good their fish tacos were on Yelp and I decided to give that a try.  They were fantastic.  I loved the fact that they were accompanied by three different sauces.  They consisted of a mild sauce, verde, and hot sauce.  All three were terrific.  They all paired perfectly with the fish tacos.\n\nFor desert, they sell churros.  Mind you, this is the only dessert on the menu.  In my opinion, they don't need to sell anything else.  They were THAT good!  We tried the churros with dolce de leche first.  Talk about amazing.  They were so good that we had to order seconds.  The second time around we ordered two dolce de leche churros and one covered in chocolate.  The chocolate option was just as good.  \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed T&T.  My only knock on them was the fact that they didn't serve chips and salsa.  While I was waiting for the tacos to come out I was in the mood for something to munch on.  That is only a small complaint.  Everything else was wonderful.  I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone in the mood for great tacos and churros!", "This place is everything that Mais should be. Excellent well priced food, super fresh, super yummy, strong drinks, and very reasonable prices. About $2-3 for a taco (they come in fours), and about $9 for a super strong, well made drink. Lovely relaxed sitting, great around sunset.\n\nSo why the Mais comparison? Well it's exactly the same idea almost, but here, the service is friendly and uplifting, with people that actually care.\n\nRead: when you walk in to T&T, the staff greet you, are smiling, and really nice. They take the time to spend 30 seconds just to make sure everyone has menus and understands the food, followed by another 30 seconds 5min later of friendly attention/suggestions, to make sure that our initial order is off to a great start. That 1min - whilst pathetically obvious on paper - is rare, and is a game changer. (Read my Mais review).\n\nAnyway, I will totally return here anytime in the area. Fav taco place in MTL. Loved it.

As the other reviewers wrote, it is definitely kid friendly, but also easily accommodates adults looking to grab some drinks and nomz. The food is AWESOME.

My partner had the fish taco (fried) and they were to die for. These aren't massive tacos, but they are reasonably priced and the presentation is quite stunning, and it comes with 4 on a wooden serving tray. The tortillas are clearly home-made and are awesome.

The habanero was not as spicy as I expected and it tasted great (NOTE: If you find tabasco sauce very spicy, avoid the habanero sauce)\n\nBack to the tacos - we ordered pastor (pork n pineapple). bistec (beef and fried cactus) and pescado - fish taco.\nThe fish taco was the winner of the evening. I did enjoy the fried cactus which at first looked like french fries but tasted more like plantain fried. \n\nThey had 4 cocktails and they tasted great.

The sandwich is already pre-assembled and bagged so you can be in and out in under a minute.  \n\nWe went with the classic. Unfortunately the sandwich was terrible - did they put onion gravy in it??? There was an excess of something cloyingly sweet and sticky that is completely foreign to all my banh mi endeavors.

The bread, of course, was spongy and cold but didn't seem like it'd hold up as toasted baguette either. \n\nIf there was pate in it -sigh!- then it was swallowed up by the strange gooey sweetness.

They also water down their soy sauce tremendously to the point of almost no flavor.  Sping rolls could also use more flavor.  I've made better at home.  Peanut sauce is helpful with flavor but again, could use more bang.  Sesame ball is better at dim sum.\n\nLoved the basil seed drink.  Not too sweet with a bit of chewy crunch.

We were seated promptly and were helped by the most delightful waiter.  Actually all of their staff here is amazing.  At any given point, someone would ask if were okay - it was a real team effort.\n\nOur waiter was funny and asked if we wanted English menus.  He didn't want to assume we couldn't speak French, which was nice for us stupid Americans.  We gladly took the English menus but joked about how we could just guess what we wanted - Steak. \n\nHe explained what the different options were.  My bf and I got the 7oz steak, which comes with a salad, vegetable (green beans) and unlimited fries.  I asked if there was cheese on the salad (that happens to me all the time) since I'm allergic.  He said no but returned a few minutes later and mentioned that the salad dressing might so offered oil and vinegar instead.  I thought this was such a great suggestion and couldn't have been more pleased with his attention to detail. \n\nMy bf ordered the french onion soup, which was delicious!  The salads were crisp and tasty.  \n\nThey spaced out the meal perfectly.  Enough time to digest in between.  They put out delicious hot rolls on the table with butter.  I usually don't eat the bread on the table for fear of spoiling my appetite, but they were too good to pass up. \n\nThe main course finally arrived and it was to die for.  The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way I wanted.  The green beans still had a nice crunch to them and complimented the steak well.  The fries were amazing - cooked to golden perfection.\n\nIt really was an incredible meal.

We then each got the Lobster Scallop main dish, (around 30$ plate), it was unbelievable. Served on too of a helping of veggies and unlimited fries and salad (as if we had room)!

The flow of the meal was timed nicely. \n\nFood & Service 5/5:\nI loved the warm bread they served here, this and a touch of butter made this awesome. For apps we ordered the tuna, escargot, and calamari. I really enjoyed the tuna and the escargot. Tuna was flavoured nicely and cooked perfectly with a light sear. The cheese on the snails was amazing and had that great gooy texture of melted cheese. This paired really nicely with the warm bread. The calamari was ok, I've had better at other restaurants. I think that the batter was ok, but the calarmi itself a bit underdone. Ironically enough we didn't end up getting steak here. Instead I opted for the lamb shank. This was cooked perfectly until it was almost falling off the bone. The meat was tender and flavourful. It didn't have the strong lamb taste - that you can sometimes get when ordering lamb. The rosemary sauce on the lamb was delicious. I enjoyed the green beans, which were crunchy and give the dish a nice textural element. I also enjoyed the fries, which are the thin type and they weren't too oily and had nice crunch. My boyfriend ordered the lobster with scallops and asparagus. Everything was cooked perfectly. There was this amazing lobster sauce that accompanied his dish that was creamy and had a really nice subtle lobster taste to it. After all of this we decided that there was enough room to get dessert. We ordered the molten lava cake with vanilla ice-cream. This was baked perfectly with the soft centre in the middle. \n\nFor the entire meal with apps, main, dessert with tax and tip it came up to about $100. This is a great place to bring that special someone, or to celebrate an event.

Evenings (3pm and up) tend to find the restaurant almost desolate - and thus the staff (one / two people) being very attentive.  Being popular with the business crowed due to its menu and close proximity to many of the businesses in the downtown core - it is very difficult to get a seat (or grab anything to go) during lunch time, so the staff is understandably rushed and brief during those times.\n\nFood:  You will find many a Montrealer who swears by Santa Lucia's pizzas, pasta dishes and Italian sausages, however for the prices charged the food's quality is not something to write home about (but worth a Yelp review!).  Pizzas and calzones are cooked in a stone hearth / oven which gives them an added dash of flavour (watch out, sometimes these are made \"more-oily-than-necesarry\") and some pastas are even made from scratch.

We apologized and were about to leave when he said it was okay and he'd find room... \n\nThe service was slow, he critiqued our menu selections and yelled at one of our group (who had a late lunch) for just ordering a salad. Its not like he needed to up-sell, we all were drinking as well. After being there for an hour, I asked our server if the food would be out soon, as we had an event to get to. A nearby table of two who were seated well after us got their meals a full 15 minutes before we did. \n\nThe food was adequate. A  bit saltier than it needed to be, but good. I would have probably enjoyed it if I weren't so bamboozled by the behavior of the fellow working there. We ate quickly.  \n\nWhen we asked for the bill, I indicated to the server that there something wrong on my bill and then tried to act like it was my fault. At this point I was a bit short with him. Not unkind, but losing patience. Let me preface what comes next by saying that I did leave a tip. After I'd settled and my friends were in the process of doing the same, I stepped outside to let others know we were done dinner. Once I was out of earshot, the server remarked to my friends that I was a bitch.The waitstaff called me a bitch. To my friends. \n\nWe left absolutely incredulous.

We arrived on time for our reservation, but as soon as we got in the door, we felt rushed by the wait staff.  They were constantly trying to hustle us through the meal.  We had a three course meal, and finished in well under 2 hours, even with us repeatedly telling the waiters we were in no rush and wished to take our time.   Plates were removed from the main course while some people were still trying to eat! They  clearly wanted to move patrons through as fast as possible.  This is not what I expect for a meal which cost $500 for 5 people.  The food was okay, but not great.  My daughter had the Mac and Cheese, and that was very well done, as were the salads. The Mushroom risotto was good, but I have had better. The deserts were okay, but nothing special.", "Really terrible service. I mean bad.

The Gnocchi which was the most recommended was horrible. It just tasted like undercooked dough. Did not have enough cheese in it and was maybe a handful. For almost $30 thats not reasonable at all. Did not like the servers as they were a bit rude and slightly insulting. Again the cesar salad was like $13 and so dry and had like one teaspoon of dressing. Also calamari is almost $20 and it has like 2 pieces. Was more disappointed than impressed. They like to cheap out on the ingredients. It wasn't horrible but I wouldn't recommend especially for the price.", "Sunday night and I was craving Italian, so I quickly  clicked on my Yelp app to find a nice Italian restaurant.

All information and reviews I had found talked about the great Southern/Southwest/French/Canadian fusion of the food due to the chef's background being from Texas. As Texans in Quebec, we were really excited for Kitchenette!! \n\nSadly, no where mentioned that the restaurant was bought out two months ago by a French couple. The menu we were excited about was replaced with a 7 course holiday meal option that didn't share the same excitement as what I had read about.\n\nWhile the food was decent at best, the evening itself was lacking. They seemed incredibly understaffed, we were told curtly by one waitress when our silverware was on top of our plates that they were trying to conserve dishes and water so if we could keep our fork and knife for every course. The first course of mushroom cream soup was lukewarm at best, the meats (filet mignon and chicken surprise) were overcooked and dry, foie gras was palatable but underwhelming. It took 40 minutes before our water glasses were acknowledged and filled, we had to ask twice for water. The dessert tasted as though it was leftover from last week and topped with a baileys whipped cream to help disguise the stale bite of cake. I don't mind a long dinner but we felt forgotten about several times throughout the 3 hours we were there, with multiple servers asking us where we were in our meals with two dishes coming out of order. \n\nThe two things we enjoyed: the asparagus risotto with scallop was fantastic (I don't even like scallops and this one I did) and the tiger shrimp with 5 spice sauce was deliciously creative. \n\nThe chefs/owners did both come over to say hello and apologize for the long wait. They comped us a whole shot of espresso for our wait time.

The food was just ok. Nothing special. I had the salmon which was served in a chowder (a really strange combo and that I didn't end up finishing - it's really not how I expected my diner to be... I thought the chowder was on the side) and my husband had the ribs. He told me his ribs tasted too vinger like and his bean were cold.\nOur service was pretty bad. They gave us the wrong bill, and WE only realized after we paid that this is what happened. It belonged to another table and because it was only $1 difference they didn't seem to care.\nWe went to Kitchenette to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary.... it was a pretty disappointing experience.  We won't be going back. \nI always give restaurants the benefit of the doubt, but this experience just wasn't up to bar.

From the service to the atmosphere to the KILLER desserts....Kitchenette was perfect from start to finish. \nWe started with vodka shots with homemade pickled jalapenos...basically akin to a punch in the face. A necessary evil. Then we had a selection of oysters...the tomatillo mignonette just tasted so...hmmm...just so FRESH! We are oyster cultists and welcomed the original presentation. You have to try the grilled oysters with bacon and garlic butter-YUM! Why aren't they serving these everywhere??!!\nWe opted for a bunch of small plates, but will definitely be going back to try the seafood stews. The mini po'boys were exactly what you would expect. The octopus was sublime. The japanese taco original and super tasty (I am obsessed with pickled daikon, so I may be biased). The eel tostada...yes EEL tostada was surprisingly good.  I hear it's delicious, alas I am not a huge fan of ugly, creepy eels...but I'll eat kidneys, go figure.\nDid you know that eel blood is toxic to humans?!  I digress...\nNext we had lobster nachos...brilliant idea! I may have shed a small tear. Ultimate upscale comfort food.\nAND THEN IT APPEARED....this insane dessert...probably my favourite dessert ever.....caramel, popcorn, ice cream, sticky toffee pudding heavenly magic....trust me I am not doing it justice. It was phenomenal. \nAll in all an awesome evening!", "We have heard about this place for a while now so we decided to try it on a Friday for lunch.\nWe arrived around 1:30 and the place was still almost full from the lunch hour.

So I am kinda of bummed since I was excited to try this place.\nAnd the service stayed like that the entire lunch hour :(\nSo that would be my cons....bad service and the chef is nice but very not talkative, we felt like we were disturbing him, which we probably were but it was not crazy busy. Anyway, I always prefer to hear from the chef himself about what to try so he kinda told us but the waitress was more loud and clear, thank God!\nOn the positive note, the food was awesome!! The ceviche was delicious, very light and tasty. Then we tried the crab beignet (crab cakes) which were fabulous including the \"ranch\" homemade dressing!! MMmmm!!! After this we tried the fish taco and the lobster roll which came with a butter salad and french fries with Mayo. French fries were soft and greasy. The salad was very simple. I was most excited about the piknik table where my lobster roll was served on than anything else :)\nSeriously, the food was great and I would go back for this.\nMaybe they just had a bad day for service when I went.....or I am just toooo picky! ;)", "This was our first to Montreal. We made reservations for dinner at Kitchenette after learning about the restaurant on the Cooking channel. It was Weds evening and the waiter confirmed that the menu had changed that day so there were many new items we had not seen from the menu online. \n\n    Because it was early we made a dinner of multiple appetizers. Starting with oysters on the half shell and Kitchenette's spectacular version of Oysters Rockefeller, Kitchenette lived up to our expectations. The Herb salad was delightfully fresh with Boston lettuce, fennel leaves (we think,) dill and a light vinaigrette that was simply perfect. In my opinion the Tortilla Soup with Organic Smoked Chicken was the best dish of the night. The aroma of smoke, the sparkle of the chili, and the intense tomato of this soup burst into syncopated harmony as all the Caribbean flavors performed a Latin musical in my mouth. In my opinion this soup should be called the Sunshine Soup-  all I could think of was how happy  each mouthful made me. The grilled Eel Tosada was excellent as was the Japanese Taco with Pulled Teriyaki Beef. \n\n  For dessert we had Bread Pudding with Jack Daniels and Caramel Sauce which was superb, if you like really sweet desserts- for us it was a bit too sweet. However, the post dinner espresso coffee was equal to the best we've had outside of Italy ...,(most restaurants don't know how to make good espresso- and believe me, if you want espresso the cutest cups and all the lemon peels and sugar cubes don't  disguise the \"aqua tinta\" passed off as the real thing...)\n \n  All in all Kitchenette is a restaurant not to be missed. One caveat- while on Weds the one server could keep up with the patrons, if things get busier I could see service slowing down- however they may have more servers at those times. \n\n  Still I'd say, go early, and go with an appetite to try many dishes."], "5": ["A total gem sitting at the southern edge of the gay village. There aren't enough superlatives to convey how tight this gang of chefs works to bring you downright delicious and inventive stuff, like fish basted in clementine juice and lobster nachos. \n\nTo boot, the atmosphere is really breezy and relaxed - there is a minimalist industrial feel to it - completely unpretentious and filled with all ages and strata of Montrealers.\n\nThe service is excellent.\n\nOverall one of my new favorites.", "Definitely worth a visit.  We trekked to this corner of the city on a recent trip based on the Unique Eats segment and other Yelp reviews.  The place has a magnetic charm.  The open kitchen and casually chic decor welcome you into the restaurant.  Soon thereafter you find there's a certain playfulness to the menu.\n   \nThe Japanese tacos were outstanding, as was the wine suggested by our waitress.  I wish the taco portion was split among two shells instead of large one,  and I really wish that soft corn tortillas were used instead of the hard version (it cracks and was a little greasy).  The chile rellenos and cod were both boldly flavorful.\n\nSide note:  The chef is dedicated to serving only sustainably caught fish; a decision the demands a lot of creativity and shows a lot of thoughtfulness.  Many thanks to you!", "I'm going to go ahead and say this is a world class bistro.  But emotionally prepare yourself, because you're going to pay for it.  This was our biggest fanciest meal of the season, and totally worth it.  I ate this meal literally last October, and I still totally remember it.  \n\nThe wine and whiskey list is wonderful and thoughtful.  We started with an appetizer that included mushrooms and a soft boiled egg on polenta and we were already besides ourselves.  We also shared a fantastic little green salad.  Then I had a piece of fish that melted in my mouth with expertly prepared veg, and Mark had pork that he literally was getting emotional about (I know, we are the biggest food-loving nerds ever.  Don't you want to hang out with us?  Don't answer that.)\n\nAfter dinner we went to the bar to have another round and enjoy the cozy atmosphere.

We weren't sure, but then she told us about $2 oysters and that convinced us to give it a try. \n\nThe atmosphere is roomy, modern and trendy. So far so good. We ordered the oysters. They came and were dressed with grapefruit flavor sauce and salmon roe. They were fine. \n\nThe waiter tries to sell me a bottle of wine that I'm not familiar with, but when I asked for a taste, I was told no. This is the 1st time I've even had to ask, usually I'm offered a taste. Anyway, I'm not going to order a bottle of something I do not know. I was not offered any alternatives. \n\nWe then proceeded to order dinner. Asked for the eggplant salad. Not available. Bok choy. Not available. A little annoying when we are told that the last orders of these items have just been sold when we were the only table in the entire restaurant at prime dinner time (730ish). \n\nSo we went with a spicy tuna roll, miso cod, chili rice, and grilled asparagus. The roll came right away and it was horrible. It wasn't even made with sushi rice and the rice was sweet. There was way too much rice and very little filling so I can barely taste the fish. The roll was also uneven, the ends were smaller than the middle. If you're going to charge $15 for a basic roll, it should at least be done correctly. \n\nThen about 30 minutes go by. Nothing happened. We then ask the waiter, how much longer for the rest to come? Food then suddenly comes out. The chili rice was swapped for fried rice. Not even what I ordered. Tasted a piece of the asparagus, which was cut into smaller pieces and placed on skewers. It was cold, mushy, and unflavorful. The cod was the thinnest piece of cod I've seen so I can't even see how it can be soft and flaky. The sauce was also dried up, probably from sitting out there for a while. We just sent everything back.  \n\nTo sum up, bad food and bad service with an undeserving price tag. If you're hungry, go elsewhere. Not the worst place if you just want a couple of cocktails in a trendy atmosphere."], "2": ["Really overpriced, 6 or 7$ for 4 gyozas made of beans.

I mean, if we were to have reservations at the restaurant, the least they could do is tell us 8:30pm instead of making us wait. Service was definitely slow and could have been a little faster. \n\nThe food was decent, it was nothing special.  I ordered the sobe sushi roll (honestly, I've had better sushi),  and the chicken pad Thai (not too bad).  What I liked most about the restaurant is the ambiance and the decor.

A blind waiter leads you into the room and to your seat (double doors to keep out the light) by asking you to hold onto his shoulders.

The entrees (Lobster Pasta) was alright - but I wouldn't go beyond that. I was initially afraid that the lobster meat amount would be small, but what ended up being the cause of disappointment was the pasta itself. The pasta was over-done, too soft, and semi-mushy. Were it not for the big lobster chunks, there would be no saving this dish.\n\nAny disappointment with the food, however, is never the focus of your attention because you're so concentrated on not dropping the fork and knife that's in your hand.

Granted, there was a \"+4\" beside the Lobster Pasta option, but it would've been nice had the hostess confirmed that $4 would be added to the total surcharge for ordering the Lobster Pasta over the other entrees. Sometimes it's not clear whether the menu used for groupon users is different from the restaurant's regular menu?

Aside from the menu choices you can choose to be surprised as what you will receive. Not being that adventurous, i only ordered a surprise cocktail. \nAfter you place your order you are introduced to your blind server. you will place your hands on her shoulder and your partner will place their hands on your shoulders. you are taken into a transition room, when the door behind you shuts another door in front of you opens, and you will know this because your server will tell you, not because you see this door, because now EVERYTHING is in darkness. \nYour server takes you to your table and places your hand on the chair, she explains everything on the table, the location of your water glass, the contents of the bread plate..while you sit there and take it all in. Trying helplessly to get your eyes to adjust to the darkness, trying to find your fork, listening to other tables drop their utensils on the floor. \nEvery time the server approaches your table, they announce their arrival, otherwise you would have no idea they were standing there. Our server was amazingly friendly, helpful and answered all our questions.

Everything was en pointe and bursting with flavour.\n\nFor my main course, I really wanted to try the pasta but could not decide between two choices, so I opted for both. I ordered the mezzo/half-plate for each of the ricotta tortellini and the crab pappardelle. When the dishes arrived, my tortellini order had FOUR pieces of pasta on it ($14). Don't get me wrong, the dish was creamy and rich, and while the mint complemented the richness perfectly...it was $3.50 per tortellino?? You've got to be kidding me. The pappardelle ($17) was equally good, but again, small portion and skimpy on the crab. For pasta, which is not expensive to make, I was expecting a much bigger portion size.\n\nMy husband had the pan-seared halibut. Very buttery in flavour, well-cooked (perhaps just a tad overdone) and well-seasoned. It was a small piece of fish that came with several radishes and baby asparagus on the side.

Several other friends were also a bit miffed at their pricey bills, but by then the room had become so stiflingly hot that everyone paid as quickly as they could so we could get the heck out of there.

Next,  the veal cheek & guitar string pasta, which was probably the most delicious, deeply savory pasta I've ever had, and the snow crab tagilatelle, which was amazing as well.

I was truly blown away.\nAlthough I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about wine, their wine list was full of exotic bottles I had never heard of.  We were skilfully guided through our various options and when we narrowed what we were looking for we were charmingly told the background of the particular vineyard.  \nWe went for a series of different dishes that we split. The first course (which I thought was the entire meal) was a spread of 3 quite different dishes. The crostini with the marscapone, proscuitto, and peaches was unlike anything I had eaten before. The salty sweetness combined with creaminess was incredible. \nIt was my first time eating rabbit ever and the rabbit canneloni dispelled any preconception I had. It had a savoury meatiness with a tomato sauce that was incredibly fresh tasting.  A lovely fresh buratta with tiny perfectly cooked chantrelles completed the course.\nSecond course consisted of two pork sausages on creamy polenta and a stuffed veal roll. The sausages were flecked with fennel (anise?) , which I normally dislike but brought out depths to the meat I had never tasted before. The veal roll was a wonderful meaty melange with a quails egg in the centre. \nGreat atmosphere with a great playlist and a cozy vibe. The service was the kind of crazily informed professionalism that can only come from people who love what they do and take pride in it.\nI honestly think my palate has been increased from the unique flavours I tried that night. \n Thanks for a great meal and I hope to visit next time I am in town!"]}}, "uETBXZTmQcH2SuzSdkwi8Q": {"reviews": {"2": ["Stood in line based on all the hype for this little  restaurant waaaay up the hill on St. Laurent.

Due to the fact that it's open only on weekdays and only for lunch, with quite a small compact space, the waiting time can be long. Having said that, every minute and patience is well worth it. Trust me! Don't be turned off by the long lineups or the 20-30 minute wait, you'll regret not having stayed.\n\nBeing a foodie and an avid follower of many other foodies on Instagram, Triologie is a place I had to try. No questions asked. Also because I love to support authentic, and local business. \nOnce we sat down, our very quiet and kind waitress took our order right away. Ten minutes later, our food was beautifully presented, and served pipping hot! \nWe began with the vegetarian spring rolls... These are not your ordinary, salty, supermarket spring rolls. These are extraordinary, outstanding, delicious, homemade with loads of vegetables and rice noodles inside. The rice noodles are a unexpected yet delicious touch to them. By far the best I've had!\n\nWe also had to try the marinated mushroom salad(VERY spicy!) Don't let the heat turn you away from trying them. These mushrooms were tender, with a nice touch of chewiness and extremely flavorful. Spectacular!  \n\nLastly we ordered two different types of dumplings. Shrimp with lamb, and vegetarian. You have the choice of steamed or pan fried. Both are good! I prefer steamed.  The steam brings out the tenderness of the housemade dough. Pan fried adds more of a crunchy, crusty side to them. \nSince both dumpling dishes were superb, again done to perfection and packed with flavour. I can't say anything more about them. They were little bites of joy in the mouth. \n\nOverall, Trilogie is a restaurant that I cannot wait to go back.  Even if I tried, I couldn't find anything I disliked about the place.

Oh how we love Italian food.  Especially good Italian food!\nSo my girlfriend and I spotted this restaurant on our first or second day in Montreal.  We ended up having Italian two meals in a row at different restaurants, so we waited on this one until toward the end of our trip.  We finished off our trip with a pleasantly full tummy! :)\n\nSo we arrived at Napoli a little early, about 5pm.  The front half of the restaurant was almost full, and they sat us at the last table in the front, which was near the front window.  We were both very cold, so we politely asked to be moved to the back, which they did with no problem.  We were the first to sit in the back area and were much warmer.\n\nThe menu was extensive!  So many options to choose from.... we took quite a long while deciding what to have - the waiter was not bothered by this and told us there was a lot on the menu and to take our time.  We started with a half bottle of the Orvieto Classico, which is a great light white wine!  My girlfriend had the dinner formula (soup or salad and plate combined).  She had the chicken cream soup and the Penne Salmon.  I chose the Bruschetta appetizer to arrive with her soup, and for my main dish, the Meat & Pepperoni Lasagna.  Both our meals were amazing!  She said that was some of the best Penne Salmon she's every had (and she has it almost every time she sees it on the menu somewhere!)\n\nAfter the meal, we decided on sharing a delicious Tiramisu, which is served in a large martini glass.  We also had an espresso for my girlfriend and a latte for me.  We paid with a credit card, and it's important to know that a gratuity was automatically added to the bill (15%-18%, I can't remember).  We left two dollars more as well, as we had excellent food and amazing service!  The servers were all very pleasant and my water was refilled quickly (something I pay close attention to).  All-in-all a lovely meal!  I hope to come back the next time I'm in Montreal!", "It was great. First day of the outdoor patio scene and these guys and gal were ready to rumble. Brilliant service. Wait staff were knowledgable, funny and friendly. Food was very good. Pizza 101 ways, amazing. Nice thin crust and piping hot....good oven. Pasta was through the roof. Well done!", "I enjoy stopping by anytime my Mom and I come to visit Montreal! The owner always welcomes us and I enjoy our server Ben! The spaghetti w sauce tastes so fresh and authentic!

The portions are good at a reasonable price!"]}}, "X6nzCRnOWvhM1j5q0p_3Ig": {"reviews": {"3": ["This is fantastic place to go but the food is not authentic Indian.

Tried a few of the vegetarian dishes (which, unlike the meat ones, don't come with rice or naan as a side). Nicely spiced, but not very spicy, which can be good or bad depending on your tastes. I really, really loved the naan. They have plain, onion, cheese, and garlic naan - I just had the plain and I think it's some of the best naan I've ever had.

It has a family run feel, and has been there since 1948.  There are plenty of selection of both pizzas and pastas.  We sampled both pizzas and pastas, and didn't feel like either were exceptional in any way.  The pizza crust tasted store bought, and the pasta was bland and creamy.  It wasn't what I was hoping for, but maybe that is because everyone has told me that the best pizza in Montreal is found here, and I guess I was a lot disappointed.

The first was fresh and tasty but a little uneventful.  The second was loaded with a cheap, salty parmigiano cheese that overwhelmed the flavours of the other ingredients.\n\nThe bring-your-own-wine, cash-only bit is a bit downscale given the prices.

(In old-school eating style they have a big pin-map on the wall to show where different customers have come from.) They handled our stumbling in with a smile, poured the wine, and gladly took our orders. If you need an entry-level french food experience (ie: low on the french, and a few baby steps into the eating), this is a good place to start. Some soup, some meat, some frites, some wine - enough to orient you in the right direction but not the full-blast of a more expensive restaurant over in the Old Port.\n\nThe downside is obviously quantity. I gather bistro food is meant to be quicker and lighter, and for our money was definitely that. (Ordering the sausage, for example, means one sausage.)

That being said, it's a good looking shop and nearly identical down to the burrito prep counter.\n\nFood:  A meal is only as good as the ingredients and this is where M4 has dropped the ball.  They were able to copy the look, but not the taste of Chipotle.  For a mission-style burrito it's all about the rice, beans and meat.  The cilantro infused rice at M4 lacks the freshness, aroma and flavor of the original.  Beans are hard to mess up, but I found the beans undercooked and much too firm.  Last but not least was the carnitas.  M4's meat is a far cry from the delicious, slow-cooked succulent carnitas you'd expect.  Bland, hunks of unseasoned pork leave you unsatisfied and grabbing for some hot sauce to drown your sorrows.   \n\nService: No waitresses or waiter at M4, but you do get to watch the people make your food.

But tomato sauce tasted a little weird. Owned by Chinese."], "3": ["If you are expecting something elegant or extravagant, don't go here. But, if you are looking for great sauce and amazing prices on Italian cooking, you came to the right place. \nI came to this restaurant with two other people and definitely got our moneys worth. \nWhen you walk into the restaurant, you are given a menu and asked to pick your own seat. Once you've decided on your meal, you walk up to the counter and order. One of the perks about this place, is that you can walk up to the counter as many times as you'd like. The staff was extremely friendly as we came up to order more food throughout our visit. \n\nFirst, we ordered two minestrone soups ($3.50), calamari salad ($7), garlic bread ($2), ceasar salad ($6) and the rice and cheese croquettes ($2.50). The minestrone soups were great. Warm, a good amount, and exactly what we expected. The calamari wasn't exactly what we thought it would be. To be honest, it didn't even taste like calamari. I wouldn't order this again. The garlic bread was great! We even went back to order more. The ceasar salad was good. The dressing had a very strong anchovy taste, so if this is something you enjoy be sure to get this. The rice and cheese croquettes were delicious. The sauce that came with it dictated the rest of our meal. \n\nNext we ordered Pizza Margertia ($6), Cannelloni ($9), Baked Eggplant ($9) and the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce ($9). The pizza was small, but very good. It had a thin, crisp crust and delicious cheese. The Cannelloni wasn't the best in the world, but the sauce made up for it. Same goes for the Baked Eggplant, the sauce on top of it was absolutely delicious. Personally, I thought the most basic dish--the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce--was the best. I know I've said it before but the sauce is wonderful. The noodles were cooked perfectly. \n\nThe bill ended up being around $80 with wine and sodas. Considering how much food we ate, and how much we had to bring home with us, this was a great deal. I would definitely consider coming back. I may not order any appetizers, but I would definitely try another pizza or find another pasta dish with that amazing sauce.", "Very close to my appartment. I tried both the lemon scallopini and the creamy mushroom one. Both come with fetuccini alfredo. The mushroom variation is by far the better of the two.

Also had the fried bread mozzarella, but wasn't a fan. Very bland in flavour. \n\nMy family had the pizza and they loved it. Not to expensive and it's the perfect size for a lunch or something. The pizza are definetly a must.\n\nYou have to go to the counter to order and the menu are picked up at the door. Definetly recommend this place if your looking to get your Italian fix without wanting to go through the long sit down meal ambiance that most Italian restaurants are known for.", "Average Italian faire, if you wanna call it that.

For the quality of food you get, it's such a steal. I'll be honest, this isn't a fancy italian restaurant. You order at the counter and pick up your food when it's called - super casual.

We wandered on sainte Catherine and because of the yelp review we stumbled upon this hidden gem. At first we were hesitant to stay but it was worth the stay.

This is a must try dish and i will recommend every one to try this restaurant.", "This is a great place to go if you are hungry for some tasty Italian food.

I was totally under-dressed and felt waaaay out of place. I decided to stick around to try some tacos. I took a seat at the bar and ordered carnitas tacos ($20). Well, someone needs to explain to the chef what carnitas actually are. I was served lamb tacos. Why not just write \"lamb tacos\" on the chalk board instead of calling it carnitas, which everyone knows is pork. Weird.\n\nThe tacos were okay.

They seem to make one unusual taco variety at a time, at least this particular festival.

En plus c'est un AVV, donc on n'a pas \u00e0 se sentir mal de ne pas commander \u00e0 boire! Je dois dire que la raison principale qui m'a fait choisir ce resto c'est sa note Yelp. Je dois dire que j'ai quand m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surpris, la nourriture \u00e9tait de tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9 et bien pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e; les serveurs \u00e9taient extr\u00eamement courtois et efficace (sauf pour la facture) et le restaurant \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s propre.

J'ai pris la table d'h\u00f4te et mon mari aussi. C'est une option judicieuse puisque pour 40$ on a un repas 4 services. Au 1er service, nous avions le choix entre une soupe froide de carottes (que j'ai prise) tr\u00e8s go\u00fbteuse et savoureuse ou une salade mesclun avec vinaigrette au balsamique et sirop d'\u00e9rable (que mon mari a prise) tr\u00e8s ordinaire, mais bien \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e (on est en 2014 toutefois, le mesclun balsamique-\u00e9rable aurait du rester en 2004). Au 2e service, j'ai jet\u00e9 mon d\u00e9volu sur l'entr\u00e9e de caille 2 fa\u00e7ons: supr\u00eame r\u00f4ti (ou po\u00eal\u00e9 au beurre je ne me souviens plus) \u00e0 la peau croquante et juste et assez sal\u00e9e et la chair juteuse accompagn\u00e9e de la cuisse farcie de champignon, puis pann\u00e9e et frite (la farce et la panure \u00e9taient assez fades) le tout servis sur de croquants haricots verts au beurre et une exquise pur\u00e9e \u00e0 l'artichaut.

La c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s juteuse et sa cuisson tout \u00e0 fait irr\u00e9prochable, mais elle manquait cruellement d'assaisonnement, son beurre de foie gras \u00e9tait aussi trop puissant et trop riche pour la d\u00e9licatesse de la c\u00f4te j'ai trouv\u00e9. M\u00eame chose du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la po\u00eal\u00e9e de champignons: la cuisson \u00e9tait parfaitement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e, mais le go\u00fbt n'y \u00e9tait pas (le chef de cuisine ne conna\u00eet pas le sel?).

Mon mari quant \u00e0 lui avait choisi, je crois le clou de la soir\u00e9e: un r\u00e2ble de lapin farcis et l\u00e9g\u00e8rement fum\u00e9 (je crois?) servi avec une exquise pur\u00e9e de courge musqu\u00e9e et un haricot kilom\u00e8tre (dolique asperge). J'\u00e9tais fort jaloux de ne pas avoir command\u00e9 \u00e7a! Pour finir au 4e service j'ai command\u00e9 la marquise au chocolat qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s riche (mais pas trop, juste assez) et onctueuse, servie avec des fruits marin\u00e9s un biscuit de pralin\u00e9. Mon mari lui a command\u00e9 le cheesecake \u00e0 l'ananas, qui encore une fois s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9 fort meilleur que ma marquise.\n\nMon verdict? Dans l'ensemble j'aime bien ce restaurant et je comprend qu'il soit tr\u00e8s populaire aupr\u00e8s des r\u00e9sidents. Cependant, les plats individuellement peuvent \u00eatre \"hit or miss\".

The menu changes regularly since the ingredients are seasonal and sourced locally!\n\nAnd I will be making a reservation and yes I will be ordering that foie gras appetizer!!", "Yum yum yuuuummmm!\n\nAfter listening to people rave about this place for the last five years, we finally tried it out!\n\nHoly yumminess is all I can really say...\n\nWe went on a random Tuesday evening, and let me tell you, this place was PACKED. The ambiance is really cozy - menus on the walls, dark lighting, and it's a BYOW!\n\nWe had the full course meal, and both tried different things off the menu - everything was deliciously phenomenal. A tad bit pricy, but not expensive for the quality of food being served. Possibly one of the best BYOWs in Montreal.\n\nYou've gotta try it, but don't forget to make a reservation!\n\nps. The pineapple cheesecake was soooo delicious......", "The Spot:\nWalking in off the street quartier generale feels like what my dinning room would be like around thanks giving, only bigger and full of strangers.\nThe fireplace and dim but not to dim lighting give it a warm feeling. It is a BYO so be prepared to have them offset liquor sales with paying full price for your meal.\nLike many other restaurants of late it has the chalkboard menu but fortunately a well verse waiter came to explain every option and there are multiple chalkboards to avoid you hovering over other tables feeling something like the family dog.\n\nWhat's Really Good:\nNow everything is very French and we didn't ask for any translations so we can't tell you if they can accommodate an unilingual but everything sounds amazing. You'll have trouble narrowing down your choices so going in groups may be the best choice. We were two and a third may have been the way to go.\n\nFor the record we ordered duck tartare, bavette d'agneau, filet boeuf and a surf & turf which comprised of duck and lobster. Not to mention the soup, salad and desserts which compliment the Table d'h\u00f4te.\n\nDuck tartare was a perfect portion size, fresh and very flavorful. Coupled with mushrooms it's a MUST try. The bavette is fresh and well cooked but isn't killer and can be skipped. The entrees also came out very promptly, a pleasantry many restaurants ignore much like te bread which was wonderfully fresh. Nothin in life is worse than hard bread and hard butter.\n\nPardon our french but the duck and lobster is the f**king shit! The onion puree that accompanies it steals te show. I nearly forgot to share the lobster claw it's THAT GOOD.\n\nWe ordered the filet de boeuf rare. Its nice to get what you asked for and not med rare. The potatoes are fried in bacon grease which ma give you a heart attack but you'll die smilling.\n\nDessert time, marquise au chocolat and creme brul\u00e9.\n\nMarquise has a fruit topping and an almond floor that reminiscent of a deluxe coffee crisp wafer. Its incredibly rich and will put an end to that diet you're working on but you only live once so go for it. Its a great sharing desert but don't be ashamed when you want it back for the last bite.\n\nThe cr\u00eame brul\u00e9 is great but most french restaurants will nail that dish so we'll advise you to take a risk and try something else.\n\nGood luck and let us know what you think!\n\nYou'll want to know\nTheir menu is written in french and the wait staff will likely address you in french, don't be alarmed they're quite friendly. They're open late and will take last minute reservations so don't settle for a sloppy poutine just because its 10pm and hunger struck. Lastly, like I mentioned above, its a BYO so don't forget to make a run to the liquor store first. There are two SAQ's on Mt. Royal, one open til 10pm seven days a week."], "5": ["Wow.

My dinner partner had the foie gras which he said was the best he has ever had and I had what was easily the world's best crab cake: it was flaky, tender and had not even a speck of grease anywhere near it.  For mains my dinner partner had the veal and I had the sea bass which was done perfectly. \n\nI adore the ambiance here: right on a quaint Plateau corner, small, unassuming, perfect lighting, cool tiles and even though it's loud, it's not so loud that you have to scream to your table mate in order to be heard.

I suppose this threw the waitress off because she came back to ask what our food order was again. \n\nWe started off with the charcuterie plate - and were disappointed. At 25$ it was a good size with quite a bit of cured meat BUT only 3 types: mortadella, pancetta and salami...the most basic varieties of Italian deli meat with some pickled vegetables.

It arrived bloody and he was forced to send it back. As she took it, the waitress asked if it would be ok if they just put the same piece of meat on the grill and brought it back to him...at a loss, he answered \"yeah sure\". It arrived medium-rare. \n\nMy main dish was the porchetta burger. I'm a BIG fan of porchetta and couldn't wait to try it.

It was my fianc\u00e9e's birthday and we figured that a more upscale establishment with finer food selections and a more creative menu was in order.\n\nThe service at first was slow, but the place was busy and we had a great group of people around the table (near the bathroom I might add, which I hadn't noticed until the attitude of the owner, with his slicked back hair and \"in your face style\" made it abundantly clear that he didn't care a bit about his clients, only about his appearance and cash in his pocket). My first sign that this attitude carried down to his staff was when I asked if the lasagna (the server noted that she ate the traditional version with meat in a ragout and loved it) for $9 was the same as the one for $18. Later in the evening, as I ate the $18 joke, that was cold, I realized that this pushing was strictly to bump up the bill. This poor excuse for an upscale restaurant can't justify $18 for a piece of lasagna with some strips of veal in it. \n\nWe made it clear, upon ordering that one dish, the shrimp fra diavolo, if it was too spicy, would be desired at a lower heat level, but when the server noted it wasn't too spicy, we said fine, leave it as is. That's when the headaches started (heaven forbid I complain about the lasagna being cold, or not up to snuff for $18). The dishes were delivered, a veal parmigiana, a family sized pasta in rose (vodka sauce), a salmon and a couple of other non-descript dishes. \n\nThe penne al vodka was priced at $30 and was no larger than a regular portion (unless dining in a nouvelle cuisine style restaurant of the 80's) and barely satisfied. At $15 it might have been more reasonable and it was also cold. \n\nThe veal was nothing special, the spaghetti was topped with a simple tomato sauce and the veal slathered in cheese. Any New York diner would do a better job for about $14 not upwards of $20. I've already talked about my lasagna, the salmon was overcooked and expensive and the damage started when my fianc\u00e9e received her dish that was a seafood pasta, not the shrimp dish. When the dish arrived, I tried a shrimp, my eldest tried two and my fianc\u00e9e asked to have the dish returned because it wasn't spicy at all and we were almost all done. The server protested slightly, but agreed to take it back and offered to take it off the bill when we said we didn't want anything else. We were looking forward to leaving the restaurant and going downstairs for ice cream and desert, when the server came back to inform us that the owner, the wanna-be, was not removing the imposter of a shrimp fra diavolo from the bill. \n\nThis after the marginal penne, the cold lasagna, the middling veal and slow service. My fiancee, not wanting to cause a scene, but expecting some level of professionalism and food quality for the astronomical prices, got up to speak to the owner. He immediately postured and shot back at my fiancee that she didn't know what she was talking about, too bad and \"what do you want me to do?\" as if he was looking for a fight. I couldn't believe my eyes and ears and she was almost in tears. This for over $200 with tips!\n\nHe finally relented and we couldn't get out of there fast enough, my friend embarrased as he frequented Roberto's quite a bit and told me he was shocked and wouldn't come back. I just wanted my girls to have desert, so on the way out, the obnoxious, arrogant, idiot of an owner said with a smile, as if taunting us, \"thanks for visiting\", like a poor cartoon of a restaurant owner. I replied \"I'm not so sure\" and he said in response, \"I'm not so sure!\" as if looking to get into an altercation. I just sucked it up and left, but couldn't believe the attitude of this poor excuse for an owner, maitre-D or otherwise. He should be fired by his grandfather just for that response, not to mention the over-priced, poor quality, cold food.

Un serveur s'arr\u00eate \u00e0 la table et dit \u00e0 mon amie, en pointant l'entr\u00e9e qu'on partage: \"tu ne go\u00fbtes pas?\" Mon amie de dire, surprise: \"oui oui\" et de se sentir oblig\u00e9e de prendre une bouch\u00e9e \u00e0 l'instant, \u00e9tant visiblement surveill\u00e9e! Malaise #1. Ensuite, je n'avais pas fini mon entr\u00e9e de salade qu'un serveur est venu nous voir \u00e0 notre table en nous disant: vous assiettes sont pr\u00eates, voulez-vous que je vous les apporte tout de suite? \u00c9tant toujours en train de manger mon entr\u00e9e, je demande un 2 minutes pour la terminer. Le serveur me regarde et me fait un air genre: \"malheureusement, je ne peux pas attendre, les assiettes sont pr\u00eates et je dois vous les apporter\". N'ayant pas le choix, les assiettes sont donc arriv\u00e9es avant que mon entr\u00e9e ne soit finie. Moment poche #2. Pour continuer, on commande des desserts. Mon amie et moi d\u00e9cidons de prendre chacune 1 dessert et de partager. On demande donc \u00e0 la serveuse (oui, on change de personne tr\u00e8s souvent durant le service!) de nous apporter 1 plat de beignets et 1 trilogie de g\u00e2teaux, 2 desserts \u00e9tant sur la carte. La serveuse nous dit alors, en prenant un air vraiment de jugement, que c'est beaucoup trop pour nous deux. On dit: \"pourtant, sur le menu c'est vendu 1 dessert = 1 personne, alors 2 desserts \u00e0 2, \u00e7a devrait \u00eatre ok, non!\" Elle nous obstine que ce sera trop pour nous, mais nous d\u00e9cidons quand m\u00eame d'aller de l'avant avec la commande. Elle ajoute finalement, avec un air hautain, qu'elle nous emballera les restes. Malaise #3. Finalement, lorsque les desserts sont arriv\u00e9s, le serveur (le m\u00eame qu'au malaise #2), le serveur nous a clairement jug\u00e9 quand il est venu servir les desserts. Mon amie et moi partagions 2 desserts et il a \"fait une face\" quand il s'est aper\u00e7u que nous en partagions 2. Malaise #4. Visiblement, \u00e7a aura fait jaser qu'on prenne 1 dessert chacune! Bref, le service dans son ensemble \u00e9tait assez moyen et c'est ce qui affecte ma note.\n\nDans l'ensemble, la nourriture \u00e9tait bonne, mais j'ai mieux mang\u00e9 en achetant leur pr\u00eat \u00e0 manger et en le cuisinant chez moi. Mes gnocchi \u00e9taient savoureux, mais la textures \u00e9tait manqu\u00e9e. Les beignets \u00e9taient vraiment bons, mais la trilogie de desserts tr\u00e8s ordinaire. Mes amies disent avoir bien mang\u00e9, mais ont trouv\u00e9 le service tr\u00e8s weird. \n\nL'endroit est sympathique.

The prices are very good and you can bring your own wine which is always nice for the budget conscious option. That being said the food was not exactly the best. We had the 5 course meal and some of it was good but not fantastic. The soup was super heated and it made it difficult to enjoy. It was also seriously lacking in seasoning. I never feel the need to add salt but i had to here. The appetizers were just ok, again lacking in seasoning. The main meal was pretty solid. The Duck leg confit was very very good as were the Ris de Veau. The sides on the main were boring and plain however. Some sort of undercooked potato dish that seem undercooked and underseasoned. The desserts were just plain awful. We actually sent it back. The creme brule was so burnt it was black (not sure how that left the kitchen actually) and the sorbet was freezer burned and tasting like it.

Just a few blocks from the Mont-Royal metro station, it is actually a tiny place wedged in a residential neighborhood.  There weren't more than 10 tables, and the atmosphere was very homey and intimate.  We decided to all do the 5-course option, which ranged from 48-55 bucks depending on which main course you ordered.   \n\nThe meal started with a cream of vegetable soup.  Simple and boring you might think, but it was very yummy and made us all excited for what was to come.  \n\nI then had the escargots as my appetizer, and it was absolutely heavenly.  I am a big fan of escargots, and this dish reminded me why.  The blue cheese sauce it was in was subtle but delicious, and I sopped up every last drop with my bread.  \n\nNext came a palate cleanser of sorts - a scoop of green apple sorbet dropped in some brandy.  Everyone in our group LOVED this - especially as the sorbet melted in the brandy.  I had never had anything like this during a meal, so it was a really pleasant surprise.  \n\nFor my main dish, I had the roasted quail, which I found to be well-seasoned in a nice wine sauce.  All the main entrees came with the same sides - a mix of seasonal vegetables.  The other entrees ordered included the duck dish, the filet mignon, and even the kangaroo (I got a bite- it was surprisingly tender and tasted sorta like beef).  \n\nDessert was a trio of sorbets.  Although not the highlight of the meal, it was a nice and light way to end the night.\n\nThe service was great here, even though there seemed to be only one waiter running the place.\n\nAnother great thing about this place?

They were absolutely bland. The only flavor I tasted was oil (from the deep fryer). And you might think, well that's why there's a marinara sauce accompanying it. To be honest, the marinara tasted as if it had been diluted with water. \n\nI took the american cheesesteak with onions for 9.75$.\n\nThe steak was no doubt high quality product, but it's execution was a shame.

I felt like even subway has a better cheesesteak. \n\nTo the so called chef (don't take it too personally): I don't know if you have a degree in culinary arts, but when you can't grill your slices of steak properly, you will have a problem selling the 'original' cheesesteaks.", "I liked the cheesesteak- wiz with onions, but I didn't love it.

However, since they did not have the courtesy to even respond, I will now post it on Yelp.\n\nWe dined at Verses a Friday in November expecting excellent service and meal execution.  Neither occurred.  We were clearly an afterthought to our server, but that is the lesser of the issues.  It was the food that failed and was so extremely disappointing, especially for the price.  But, this review has nothing to do with price.  We dined at Au Pied de Cochon the previous evening and spent an equivalent amount, however the level of attentiveness and quality and execution of the dishes was so far above that of Verses.  \n\nWe had four dishes, and I would have been forgiving of one dish below expectation.  However, when 3 of the 4 are almost inedible, I feel the need to address the situation.\n\nWe started with the foie gras torchon (as expected) and the sweetbread.  The sweetbread was very minimal and completely overcooked, dry and falling apart as we attempted to eat it.  It lacked flavor and the richness typically associated with the dish.\n\nFrom there we had the wild boar and the cod with poached egg.  The boar was overcooked - certainly not the medium rare we ordered - as well as tough, chewy and flavorless.  It reminded me of a cheap pork chop.  The cod was extremely overdone - dry and cold.  The 'poached' egg was hard-cooked. \n\nHad our server come to check on us, we would have mentioned these issues.  He did not.\n\nLast, we ordered dessert and coffee for my husband.

Unless you have never experienced your Nonna's cooking, you would probably think this place was good. 2 Thumbs Down from a Food Critic..", "So I know this place is very popular and gets recommended a lot. But I have to be honest about my critic and not give it a high score just because everyone else did. So here is my take on Da emma.\n\nWalked-in to this old dark place, very little lighting, which wasn't a big surprise as I knew this use to be a prison. Sit down and waiter comes immediately, please take into account that this is my first time at this place, and we tell him this. Then he says okay okay I will bring you some nice artichoke to start then I will bring you our famous delicious rack of lamb with potatoes on the side, I will also bring you pork chops, which I told him I don't eat pork. So then it's like he got thrown off, okay okay then I will make you veal breast with rosemary and spaghetti with a nice rich homemade tomato sauce. So we said okay, And he left, I kept asking myself if the had menus but didn't see anyone with it so I just presumed this is how it work. \n\n5 minutes later our appetizers arrive, he brings me  a plate of prosciutto  and and a small plate of artichoke .... Ummmm didn't i just mention I don't eat pork??? Anyways, then the waiter just stand at our table waiting for us to eat (that really annoyed me) artichoke  sucked to hard, too oily. \n\nThen the main meal came, OMG the veal was over powered by rosemary, you could 't actually taste the meat, the lamb did not smell good and was too dry. The potatoes were also overwhelmed by rosemary and the pasta was not good at all. Honestly if your homemade sauce is tomato paste you need to rethink about your recipe.\n\nWith our food we had ordered a bottle of flat water and a glass of wine.  \n\nSo like I mention since we never got a menu we never knew the prices either. At the end we just didn't enjoy our food and just wanted to get out of there, we declined coffee and dessert. We asked for the bill. 289$ Are you crazy????? Omg that much money for that mediocre food. Ughhh I will never go back and I definitely will not recommend it. \n\nOh by the way as I was leaving the restaurant, we realized they had a menu, its written on a blackboard that they bring to your table. Our stupid waiter never even mentioned it. Royally pissed off!"], "2": ["Meh .\nDa Emma has now officially joined the ranks of \"just any other Italian restaurant\" in Montreal.\n\nThis used to be my favourite Italian restaurant in Montreal. I would make it a must stop for everything from birthdays to wedding anniversaries, to graduation fetes. I'm not quite sure what happened here. :(\nBetween getting cold (yes, COLD) pasta sides to getting a different side from the one that I had ordered, albeit without even having been told. All the way to not even getting acknowledged half the night by our server (I had to flag him down most of the time. Really?! When many main dishes are over $40, why am I running after servers?) To getting bottled water when it was never even requested. I had even asked to get another table in the restaurant (as it was pretty much half empty) and the table I asked for didn't even have a \"reservation\" sign on it. No big deal, right? Wrong. I was awkwardly told \"Sorry, we save that other two-spot table in case we have to push two sets together for a party of four\". Okay, that's fine.\nKnow what happened? \nThey pushed the tables together alright - for another couple. They had their nice big spot and we stayed put. What happened to saving it for a party of four? Am I missing something here?... \nWhat a disappointment. Cold food is never okay. Off nights happen, but it won't change that I'm likely not going to go back. Having been to many top restaurants in New York City like Babbo, Del Posto and Scarpetta, I'd say Da Emma should re evaluate their service. Times are tough, people! If you want to keep charging your exorbitant prices you better make it worth the customers' time and money.

Yelp had also steered us away from Little Italy, and we were hoping we would hit on something better.\n\nThe Osso Bucco is a different, Roman-type preparation, which the waiter explained up front. I found it slightly tough and on the bland side. The broccoli was over-cooked and way too salty. The pasta is non-descript. Given this, the restaurant is overpriced in my opinion.\n\nMy husband had a fish dish that tasted pretty good. He seemed to like it but didn't rave. He couldn't remember which one it was.\n\nOur friend ordered a pasta dish and said it was good, but it didn't look extraordinary at all. We wouldn't try it again or recommend it to others.", "I came to Da Emma on a Friday night around 6pm, right when they open for dinner service. I adore the architecture/layout/atmosphere with the heavy metal doors and the rustic feel of the ex-womens' prison. \n\nIf you look to your right upon entering the restaurant, you'll see boards filled with pictures of eminent celebrities, athletes, randoms posing with I guess, Da Emma. Knowing that Angelina Jolie, Diane Kruger, Joshua Jackson, George Clooney (to name a few) had also dined at Da Emma made the experience more memorable.\n\nWe were seated right away and brought a plate of bruschetta and the menu. The bruschetta was more like a salty olive oil-ed sponge, not impressed. Our server literally plopped the all-Italian menu in front of us and peaced out with no explanation, no translation (even thought my boyfriend is Italia, he struggled with some of the items). \n\nWe ended up ordering the leg of lamb ($35) and veal ($30?). You have a choice of sides: veggies (pickled potatoes, 2 slices of eggplant, 2 slices of zucchini) or rotini with tomato sauce. The main dishes were enormous. If you are on the fence when it comes to lamb, I suggest you steer away from it at Da Emma. It's way too big- I couldn't manage half of it. The veal was amazing though! \n\nAll in all, the food was alright. Nothing too exciting. Our server was slow, cold, and intimidating, which is exactly what Da Emma is like."], "4": ["Great Restaurant. Fantastic Food and Wonderful atmosphere. Highly recommended.", "When a fellow foodie friend of mine (say that three times fast) informed me this was either his favorite or second favorite restaurant in town I knew I had to try it. When I was able to get reservations for that night (granted it was a Thursday) I figured it was fate and I had to stop by. I'm so very glad I did.\n\nWe arrived right on time for our reservation and were seated promptly. The waiter stopped by, took cocktail orders, dropped off some bruschetta, and left us with the oil board menu which is entirely in Italian. After staring at it for a good few minutes and taking pride in being able to identify a small handful of the items, the waiter came back to explain what it was we were reading.\n\nWe started with the caprese, which was done up very simply and exactly how I wanted it - fresh and not overly elaborate. For my main I tried the pork osso bucco. If you know anything about me it's probably that I love osso bucco; if I see it on the menu I'm ordering it. This was probably the most unique osso bucco I'd ever had. It had a sauce that was white wine based as opposed to red, and had a flavor that I wasn't expecting. Don't get me wrong - it was awesome, but just off center. My wife went for the veal meatballs, which were melt-in-your-mouth amazing but not in the least bit brittle. The one thing I didn't care too much for was the fact that the pasta that was served with everything seemed like more of an afterthought than anything. Granted with my dish it didn't matter too much, but it would have been nice to have had some great pasta to go with the meatballs.\n\nAfter we were finished dining our service took a severe turn for the worse. We weren't able to flag down our waiter for a good 10 minutes after finishing our meals. Not to be deterred, we still went with dessert (wasn't going to let that affect our meal), and we tried the tiramisu. Simply outstanding.\n\nI'd love to go back, and I'm sure this is a 5 star place. But the server disappearing for a solid 10 minutes and the pasta really do knock this place down one notch. But even still, my recommendation is still this - go! Enjoy!", "We had a wonderful dinner at Da Emma!\n\nGranted, it wasn't a traditional dinner -- there were about 30+ people for my cousin and his fiancee's pre-rehearsal dinner for out-of-towners.\n\nFirst of all, the setting is spectacular.

This restaurant was recommended to us by a staff member at our hotel, saying it was \"A-1\" and the best restaurant for Italian that you could find. So, with that in mind, we walked the 10-15 blocks to the Restaurant Da Emma, hoping for a meal we would not forget...trust me, we won't! It is in the basement of a large building, a few blocks away from the action of shops, people, etc. You walk down the flight of stairs, through a couple of what look like warehouse doors, and into the elegant entry area. Walking towards the front counter, we noticed multiple large class frames house many pictures of very famous people (Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman, the guy from\nSlumdog Millionaire, etc.). Walking to the front counter, the woman asked if we had reservations, unfortunately the answer to that was no. She hesitated and was explaining that it was very hard to get in here and you need reservations, but she did end up letting us have a table as long as we were done by 8:30. Fine with us! We were then waited on by a very friendly, funny, yet proper waiter. The menu was incredibly extensive (yes, expensive, but incredible & worth it). we ordered, and a little while later our food was delivered...YUM! It was heavenly! Everyone loved their meal and ate every last bite! Now it's dessert (oh yeah!). We ordered both lemon & orange sorbets to share (best decision of our entire lives)! they are served in whatever fruit flavor you order (example: the orange sorbet was served in the \"shell\" of an orange). This was a superb presentation and the sorbet was so incredible, I think I might just order that every day of my life (even of they would have to ship it to California)! \n\n Overall, one of the best dining experiences I have EVER had, and definitely the place to go when in or near Montreal!!", "I don't write about every restaurant I eat at, just the ones that show something special. This is truly a five star old school Italian restaurant. Anyone who gives it less is just screwing with the ratings (and I've been to most of the north beach restaurants). Got recommended by the concierge at the Marriott. I applaud anyone who could find it without a taxi. It is less than nondescript from the outside. Once you go down the stairs and through the industrial door you come upon a busy place. People will find good food. The menu is in Italian. It is extensive and the staff is happy to translate. The wine lists also extensive and all Italian. The sugar packs are from Italy. Getting the pattern here. They are not afraid to scream old Italy because they can do it first class. Soup of the day was stingray soup. I was thinking Asian, but noodles in seafood broth  with shredded stingray fin was right off the coast of Italy. There were so many great things on the menu. I chose the Osso bucco, great. My wife had the fettuccine with mushrooms, fantastic. Would I go again. You bet. I will say I asked them to call me a cab to get back to the hotel, after all it is near old town but a little of the beaten track."]}}, "nBBEE1YVO0atXbkxfrNPhQ": {"reviews": {"1": ["Terrible service.

My suggestion for the person in charge of creative control is this: it is better to do very little, perfectly, than to be ambitious, but fall short of gold.\n\nFor 450 Canadian you might do better elsewhere.

Don't mention this restaurant in the same sentence as Per Se, French Laundry, Alinea, or Daniel--I've been to all of them and this place is nowhere near that kind of quality. We had to ask for drinks several times. Our food was awkwardly paced with 10 minute breaks between some dishes and then 2 minute breaks between other dishes. At best, this would be a one-star restaurant in terms of service.\n\nSecond, the food. It was ok. It wasn't great, and it wasn't bad. If I was staying at the St James and just needed a meal without leaving, I'd come here, but with all the alternatives around the neighborhood, forget it. Here's the difference between Per Se and French Laundry--they never repeat a single item on their (larger) tasting menu. In our six course menu, we had some form of curry twice (33% of the dishes), some form of chocolate three times (50% of the dishes), and everything was overly sweet. Each item by itself would have been good, but the point of a tasting menu is that dishes should interact and lead into each other. \n\n\nWould I recommend this place for the food? No. Was I impressed by the wine list? Yes.", "This is a place to go to experience sheer beauty and extravagance when it comes to the room and their great wine list. I've attended two business dinners here. While I truly enjoyed drinking expensive French wines, the food is just too unconventional and strange. The other night I had the asparagus starter, which consisted of one under cooked fresh green spear, and one semi pickled white spear,  The spears laid on two different kinds of foam and covered with flower petals and other garnishes.  It looked more like a flower arrangement than a dish.  For the main I had a strange concoction of freshly made fava beans pasta served with seafood and proscuito sauce. The pasta reminded me of buckwheat soba noodles.  Unfortunately this mixture was only tad better than the two spears of asparagus.  However my carnivore colleagues thoroughly enjoyed their steak and foie gras.", "I am not so high on this place. The night we ate here it was really empty. There might have been one other table and we sat down around 7:30p.  The interior looks like a small old palace. Maybe it's an old bank.

They are also most hospitable and kind with no aloofness from working in such a rarified atmosphere. Observing their technique makes the drinks taste even better. They make all of the classics plus some special St. James drinks. They will make any drink exactly to your specifications.\n\nThe bar food menu has some great items. The Montreal \"Smoked Meat\" Sandwich with fries is not to be missed. It may be the best pastrami sandwich ever. For dessert, consider the strawberry dessert, which features fresh Quebec strawberries, strawberry gel, strawberry paper, maple crumbles, hazelnut ice cream and stracciatella cream (wow!!).\n\nFor an after dinner drink, try \"Neige\" which is a local apple ice wine aged three years.

Interiors are nice, Service is friendly although still lacking of a good routine (that's ok, the place just opened). \nWe were told the dishes are inspired by the asian surroundings of the neighbourhood (Chinatown) and are meant to be shared on the table (tapas-style). Ok, so we ordered BBQ pork with oyster emulsion, braised Napa cabbage, roasted beef with veg, saut\u00e9 of squid and courgette (13$), and finally, \"crevettes popcorn\", deep-fried shrimp in batter. \n\nBeef ($15) and pork ($13) were ok, although the pork was a little dry. The cabbage ($8) was terrible since it was literally swimming in oil and came in full-sized leaves, impossible to eat with chopsticks (they offered a knife once we were finished). Besides, it had some bad off-flavours from unburnt gas. The squid saut\u00e9 only contained a very small amount of courgettes, the rest was tasteless dried noodles and something like cabbage - boring is the only word that comes to my mind here. The \"crevettes popcorn\" ($7) sounded interesting on the menu but arrived as lame breaded or battered shrimp that had been in the deep-fryer too long, resulting in very bitter aroma - no sauce or dip to kick it up a notch. \nSumming up, I think \"uninspired\" is the best description I can give. All food maybe would have been okay in a neon tube chinatown setting. But we certainly expected a little more, particularly when we saw the cheque ($72 for 2 incl. ginger ale and a beer). \nThere are other places that do it better at a more reasonable price (although", "Despite all the good reviews for this place, I will stick to my initial comment: if u go to a so call Asian restaurant and there are no Asian people inside, get the f*** out!\n\nFood was either too salty or too sweet.

Ive decided to still give it a try sinxe many of my foodie friends have had good comments about the place. \n\nSeriously don't understand why people say it's one of the best restaurants in Montreal. Alright the place looks decent considering that it is in Chinatown but food just is ok."], "3": ["This restaurant definitely has something going for it, although they might need to iron out a few kinks (as do most new restaurants). We arrived at 8:15PM on a Saturday night and managed to snag the last table. \n\nWe ordered the Blanchailles Frites & Arachides Sriracha, which were great to snack on. Would go perfect with a beer, but we opted for a cocktail (Old Royal Jelly - A Old Fashioned style cocktail, and a Golden Slumber - very refreshing, almost mojito like). \n\nWe then had the BBQ Pork, which was perfectly cooked. Moist and a fatty belly, the oyster emulsion was also great. Also had the aubergines. This dish was good, but nothing to write home about. Also the aubergines really need a knife to cut through, something that should have been provided to accompany the chopsticks. We switched to the Barbaresco from Langhe for this course, which was a good balance for the BBQ Pork & also didn't overpower the fish. \n\nNext up was the Omble Chevalier. This was served in three ways. 1) Sashimi; 2) Poached; 3) Grilled. The sashimi and the grilled filet were excellent. Simple & clean flavours. I'm not normally a big fan of poached fish, and this one didn't wow me either. However, given my aversion to poached, I'll still give this dish a thumbs up. \n\nDesert was the Xiao Long Bao. A nice take on the original. Points for creativity, but I think it was a bit confused. The table next to us had the orange ice cream, and were raving about it, so I will try that next time. \n\nOverall: As I mentioned earlier, they have a few kinks to work out service wise. The waiter needed to be reminded about our wine, and had a bit of trouble opening it in the cramped tables. Also had some trouble pronouncing Okinomiyaki (which I know is a mouthful, but should be known by the staff). I'm also kinda comparing it to Cafe Sardine, which had impeccable service. \n\nI will return here soon & hope that all the opening jitters have been settled.

Come to think of it, yeah I would come back for a drink, to eat not so much.

You will never see this in a real chinese restaurant, it's just not done, not because people haven't thought of it but because the dumpling texture is just not right with something sweet, it's just mushy and sweet, one note, no symphony here.\n\nThe ice cream was another story, it had very nice orange flavor and not tangy at all.

The soft crab fried rice was the highlight you got to try it!", "We had dinner this weekend at Orange Rouge, an Asian inspired tapas restaurant on the outskirts of China Town. While far from spectacular, this restaurant did have some strong points. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is decidedly underwhelming, black on black with punches of red, it has the feel of a restaurant that turns into a bar/club after a certain hour (which it should because the cocktails are fabulous). The main highlight of course is the three arches behind the bar that lets you see all the action in the kitchen; while this type of design usually fills a restaurant with an ungodly clamor, this doesn't seem to be a problem at Orange Rouge. Instead the atmosphere is set by laid-back RnB mixes played at the perfect volume point, allowing for conversation (chalk it up to my old-age but I actually enjoy conversing while eating).\n\nFirst strength, customer service, honestly everyone there deserves a raise. From the get-go the staff was considerate of our experience. Upon arrival, the hostess made sure to find out if we were due at a show later on (it was juste pour rire), later the waiter graciously accommodated the nut allergy of my dinner companion (which we only remembered when the first dish arrived), and was incredibly attentive the entire meal. \n\nI ordered an East Meets West campari cocktail and it was on-point, if you love sour drinks this ones for you. My friend's Mai Tai wasn't as good but that's what you get for choosing a vodka based drink. \n\nFirst plate up was the sauteed squid, wild leeks and smoke tofu. It was incredible. The taste was smokey and the tofu was perfectly textured. It was so good we were worried everything after would be a disappointment. and it was. The next dish (brunt eggplant green beans and pork) was just a lunch-bag let down. The egg plant was taste-less, the green beans under-cooked and the ground pork was dry and crumbly, which didn't suit the dish at all (not to mention hard to eat with chop sticks). This dish is confused and needs to be re-thought from top to bottom. \n\nHowever, the soft crab fried rice saved the day, it was delicious, like a high-end version of take-out Chinese rice, not as good as the first plate but it definitely ended the meal on a high-note. \n\nAll-in-all I would recommend Orange-Rouge for date nights, nights out with friends or even company events."], "5": ["Ok, I really liked this and I'll tell you why and mostly it's because everything about this place is unexpected. On an underdeveloped edge of an odd corner in Chinatown you find this brand new restaurant behind an odd facade. From outside and in you can see it's divided into two. One side, the kitchen, is brightly lit like a showcase with a crowd of diverse cooks. Like a live show you watch from the comfort of your table on the other side, in the dining room, where it is dim with clean warm hanging lighting, black and purple and glowing neon red crab decor, but not quite in an 80s way. It sort of nods smilingly at that 80s scene though, with black carpeting on the walls and such, but the food and cocktails are playful and new and the ambiance is modern, elegant, cool. \n\nMy Royal Jelly cocktail was weird and wonderful, like a Chinatown Manhattan.

Regardless of when everyone else shows up, you can at least let someone sit at the bar for an hour dinner when they're is only two other tables seated in the whole place.  We definitely would have been gone by the time the last reservation arrived.  I can't really truly convey how disappointing and almost downright humiliating it is to be told the restaurant is booked when there are 8 people sitting in the entire place and 20+ empty tables.\n\nWhile I understand opentable and the reservation system (and often use it myself), there is something to be said for being a human being and making a little effort.  Perhaps a nicer explanation and an offer of a drink and an appetizer at the bar.\n\nI'm a little disappointed in myself for not making even a little bit of a scene, or being as rude to the hostess as she was to us.  I'm not normally that way, and rarely consider doing so in a restaurant (especially where I'm planning to eat), but I was downright PISSED at the haughty \"we don't give a sh*t\" about your patronage attitude as we walked down the street.\n\nWe ended up going a few blocks away to Chez L'epiecier\nhttp://www.yelp.ca/biz/chez-lepicier-restaurant-bar-a-vin-montreal \nfor one of the best meals of my life.  Save yourself some frustration, and just go there instead if you don't mind spending a few dollars more.\n\nI'm sure the food is probably good if you don't mind the potential of being treated like just another diner.

I probably woulda' put 4-5 stars, based on the quality of the food. But the waiter just brought the bill and I asked him to put 10% tip on the bill... Pretty standard in Canada... He said how about the usual 15% and then added it and totaled it before I could say a word. And then after printing out the bill he asked, so where you from? I speak fluent French... But with a small accent. So if this is how they treat my kind of tourist imagine your kind of tourist.."], "3": ["Me and my wife both had the tasting menu. I had the vegetarian version of it.\n\nOverall impression: Lots of potential but fell short in the flavor department on 2 out of 5 dishes.\n\nI started with a beet salad amuse-bouche. This one was excellent.. full of flavor and layers, great presentation. I normally don't even like beets but this dish, I loved.\n\nThe appetizer was a cucumber with goat cheese salad, with grape slices and nuts. The presentation was once again was beautiful but the taste fell a bit short. I am not a goat cheese fan to begin with so perhaps some people would love it. I felt like the dish needed something like lemon or herbs to add more layers to the flavors which were overpowered by the strong goat cheese.\n\nThe entree was a turnip \"pasta\" bowl with parmesan and trumpet mushrooms/puree. Very original dish. It's surprising how well the turnip felt as a spaghetti of sorts. Flavors were strong but very nicely balanced with some lemon. Definitely a winner.\n\nThe main meal was the reason I gave Les 400 Coups 3 stars. It was a \"slab\" of butternut squash with some mushrooms/nuts/various greens. The butternut squash itself was amazingly done, it was extremely smooth, buttery and silky. The ingredients around this main piece were all correct and well chosen, however what lacked heavily was flavor. It lacked salt/pepper and perhaps something like lemon/onions/basil/flowers.. something to add more punch to it. It was just very flat tasting and not too interesting. It's really too bad because the potential is there in the dish, it just wasn't executed very well. \n\nThe 2 desserts were exceptional. Some of the best we've had. The \"Vert\" dessert was especially unique and bursting with flavor. I had never tasted white chocolate yogourt with green apple before.. The second dessert was a chocolate mousse with pear sorbet and my wife got a strawberry jelly with sorbet. Both were very very good and given the ingredients I listed I don't need to describe the flavors!\n\nService was adequate, nothing amazing but fairly good. They didn't take away our wine glasses even though we didn't want wine, which was kinda weird. The waitresses were friendly and attentive to our questions/comments.\n\nMy take on Les 400 Coups: We'll check it out again in a year. There's definitely a ton of potential in it. There's a lot of great things about it and like I told my wife: they get it. They just need to work on the vegetarian main dishes more and add more punch and rounded flavors to them. My wife thought her tasting menu (with meat) was excellent. Also the presentation in every dish was great.\n\nI give it 3 stars but I think that it's closer to 3.8 or so.. I just didn't want to give it 4 because they did fall short on the main meal which is a no-no to me. It's definitely worth a try.", "This one gave me some trouble - I think it's a decent place but gets lost in the million other bistros in this city. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with it, in the sense that it ticks all the right boxes - the decor is classy, airy, and modern with tall ceilings. The location is romantic (old port), and they serve tasty, albeit marginally creative small dishes at the usual high prices. \n\nThe problem is, there is nothing really offbeat or quirky about it, kind of in the same way a Lexus is a good sensible all-rounder but ultimately not really desirable. Petoncle tartare, a piece of nondescript white fish with a confit of some sort on top. The fact that I can't remember what exactly I had says something about the impact.\n\nAt the end of the meal , picking my teeth with a toothpick, I was thinking to myself \"Nice place, but Deux Singes was better.\"", "We just returned last night for our third meal here. Needless to say, it's quite good.  We were hungry when we arrived last night and selected our dishes from the small menu. We placed our order and asked to speak to the sommelier for wine suggestions. We selected our wine, and as she went off to get our bottle, our starters arrived. I don't know if it was because we were eating so late (10 pm), but the timing of the meal was a bit off to start. \n\nThe wine arrived in short order and we tucked in to our first course: the lobster with crispy chicken skin, and the beef tartare. The lobster was delicious---perfectly cooked, plump bites, topped with a sprinkling of crispy chicken skin and a sabayon. There was some cumin in there somewhere, which was surprising and not altogether welcome, but overall the dish was very good. The beef tartare, I'm afraid, was grisly. The flavours were okay, but the texture was not. After the first course, we asked that they slow down the pace of the meal, and they happily complied. The service is good here--attentive and efficient. \n\nNext, we received the main courses: Scallops with french beans and wild mushrooms in a buttery lobster bisque with curry (Indian spices again, but it worked better here). The scallops were sweet and tender. Excellent. My companion had the veal sweetbreads, which he loves and orders whenever they are on the menu, anywhere. They came in a tasty yuzu sauce. He likes his sweetbreads to be really crisp, and there were portions that he didn't eat, but overall, he enjoyed the dish.        \n\nOne thing that is always perfect at Les 400 Coups? THE DESSERTS. Do not, under any circumstances, skip dessert here.  It is wonderful. We had \"The Green\"---yogurt, apple, pistachio, olive oil....you get the picture. Totally interesting, fresh and delicious. We also had the vanilla cardamom mousse---also good (but if it's your first time, get the chocolate pot-de-creme---it's awesome). \n\nAll in all, a good meal. I would have given another half star if Yelp allowed it."], "4": ["We went here a few weeks ago, after they just opened.\n\nmy friend knows the chef and we had gone to Newtown when he used to work there last year. We really liked Newtown and had the nicest surprise, so naturally we wanted to try this out.\n\nI guess the name of the restaurant is a play on the address and an obvious reference to the new wave french movie from Francois Truffaut.\n\nI really like the chefs here, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Jett\u00e9 chef, and Patrice Demers pastry chef, they have a very fresh take on food and are very passionate about what they make.\n\nThe place is dark and subdued, the ambiance is very trendy, but relaxed and not austere. The staff is warm and always smiling.\n\nafter dinner we went and peeked into the kitchen, and it was very clean, I saw this beaker with boiling water inside, reminded me of old chemistry lab... anyhow anyone can see the kitchen since the door has a glass insert so you can see them work in the kitchen.\n\nOnto the food,\n\n we had the mackerel, the butternut squash tartlet, and the lamb shank. all three are mains, because we opted to have an extra main instead of an entr\u00e9e.\n\nThe mackerel consisted on a grilled piece of mackerel laid on 3 duck ravioli in a broth and some pur\u00e9e of parsnip. This was our entr\u00e9e substitute, it was light and somewhat of an experiment in contrasting textures. My friend liked the idea, i didn't it was a weird dish that didn't harmonize well, even though each element was well executed. I was disapointed...\n\nThe other two mains that we had were quite exquisite!!!\n\nThe lamb was exceptional, cooked to perfection, and the taste was sooo good, good sauce and good sides. My friend does not like to eat meat, but she wolfed it down in no time...\n\nThe butternut squash tartlet was very original, and tasted amazing. saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, butternut squash mash, some greens, mixed up and garnished with pie crust pieces. it was kind of a deconstruction of a tartlet but it looked great and tasted great.\n\nOn to dessert\n\nwe had the pot de creme, of course, because it's the pastry chef's signature dish, and the yuzu cream.\n\nThe pot de creme is as always, amazing, smooth and creamy, just sweet enough and the hint of salt just rounds it out. This dessert is evil, you will want to order another one, and we were tempted by the waiter but successfully resisted because it is obviously all fat!!!! but it is really really good.\n\nthe yuzu was blah, first of all i don't like yuzu, and came out as this rectangular cubic log, which was a tangy sort of gelled custard  some meringue crackers and basil garnish. I don't like tangy, and I didn't like this, but my friend liked it... \n\nall in all, we had two superb mains and an awesome dessert, that was very good dinner", "Foodie place with small seasonal menu.  Everything very well prepared.  Had interesting flavor combinations, and it does have an excellent (salted) Pot au Creme.\n\nA little noisy, nice ambiance.  Pretty space.", "I was excited to check this place out on a recent trip back home. We were unable to get resos for Garde Manger but were happy to try Les Coups. They were rated one of the top 10 new restos in Canada by enRoute, along with Toronto's Campagnolo, so I figured they knew what they were talking about. Not surprisingly, of these top 10 newbies, MTL held three spots. \n\nI'm not sure what time the place closes but it was a Thursday night which was unnaturally dead in MTL. It may have been the horrible weather (rained like crazy), but when we arrived for our 10:30pm reso, all but two small tables were occupied in the dimly-lit space, located in Old Montreal. The decor was alright, a lot of dark colours, huge walls covered in images of a typical Paris neighbourhood, loved the ceilings...apart from that, nothing crazy. It may have been the time of day but I found service among some of the servers could have been a little less blah. But it's all good, it wasn't as though they were being offensive or rude. One younger woman with dark hair was especially nice.\n\nThere was a decent selection of dishes to choose from that evening. I started with the whipped goat cheese which was delicious and light-tasting, with clean flavours to whet the appetite. I didn't think it would be as substantial as it was but I was happy with the long curly slivers of cucumbers enveloping almond pieces, with a dab of honey jelly among the little balls of whipped cheese, and a couple of thinly-sliced grapes, which combined, would equal about 1/3 of a whole grape(what's up with that?). This dish, while not using the most expensive of ingredients, was clearly a laborious one to make and at $12, was well priced. My friend ordered the scallops which seemed more like a ceviche as it was almost raw. I don't remember how it was described on the menu (definitely not seared) but there was some warm creme fraiche-type deal on it (it was actually some kind of mild sauce of sorts) with black caviar strewn about the plate. I imagine the caviar was intended more for presentation or even texture, but it wasn't very flavourful and lacked any real texture as it bloated from cooking in the warmth of the sauce. The baguette they provided was terrible (surprising) and rock-hard--could be that it was the end of day but not a big deal as I wasn't there for the bread.\n\nNext up, I had the wild bass--one of my fave fishes. Also a hit. Good sized slab of fish, perfectly crisped skin and edges, with maitake mushrooms and white asparagus. The vegs were SO TASTY, like they'd been seared with a really fatty rib steak. MMMMMM! My friend's beef short ribs were supposedly cooked for 72 hours, which I believe. I don't even know how they could have plated the thing without it crumbling into a million pieces as it was SO incredibly tender! So good it was, surrounded by what I think were hearts of palm and a lot of beets--some really pretty ones that were red, white, and spirally. I don't remember what type they were, only that they were of a Japanese variety. Both mains were excellent.\n\nLes Coups' pastry/dessert? chef is one celebrated Patrice Demers so it didn't make sense not to have dessert! I had the panna cotta which featured a quenelle-shaped \"piece\" of ice cream, some hand-torn spice cake that was spiced just right, pumpkin seeds, and other little details which escape me right now. It was OK, but not the orgasm I was expecting. My friend's pot-de-creme was the typical caramel pudding concoction with salted toffee you see a lot these days. That too was alright, but again, nothing special. (I say Campagnolo's version is way better.) We were probably the only ones in the restaurant who didn't order any wine so I can't say much for their selection, but we did order a few cocktails and drinks which were generous on the alcohol. ;)\n\nAll in all, we were happy with our meal that night at Les 400 Coups--definitely worth checking out if you like contemporary French food, or merely curious. I noticed on their website they have a prix fixe lunch menu. I've no idea what portion sizes are like then but they sound like a pretty good deal if you've got more than an hour to spare over a lingering lunch."], "5": ["One of the best meals we have had in many years. Complement and counterpoint. Les 400 Coups's average rating should not suffer because two people couldn't get in the door or because the place has a totally reasonable policy against people just drinking at the bar.\n\nAn appetizer of local French beans was fabulous. A terrific flavor combination of smoked bread, extra-vieille Mimolette, and fresh beans.\n\nSweetbreads were nice and light. Very good accompaniment of spelt and miniature radishes. Even with beurre noisette, it was neither rich nor cloying. \n\nPot de cr\u00e8me is often a dessert for small children. This version was, in keeping with the evening's theme, surprisingly light.

He proceeded to pour a glass, and then he took what looked like his thumb and index finger and grasped around in the glass as if he was trying to fish something out. \n\nBy the time the wine arrived I was a little skeptical of whether or not I wanted to drink it. I settled on \"No, I don't\".  But before I could ask him about the finger fishing, he had turned and left again. Now, it's important to remember that at this point it's about 8:45 and the restaurant is mostly empty, with the exception of one group inside and a lone gentlemen seated on the patio with me.  I can appreciate that he was working multiple tables,  but It was obvious that I was playing second (or third) fiddle to the other diners.  \n\nThe Pizza finally arrives.  I take a bite.  Not good.   It's greasy, and flavorless.  It's also incredibly small, Four slices for 15 dollars.  A single olive on each slice.  Worth a 30 + minute wait ?  Hell no. \n\nMy absentee server returns, finally noticing that I haven't taken a single sip of my wine.  He asks why and I tell him point blank it is because I saw him violate it with his fingers.  He seems quite surprised by this, and attempts to explain that he was removing bits of cork for me.  I tell him that I don't care about cork in my wine , but I do care about his fingers. After a moment or two of awkward silence and pained facial expressions he apologizes and offers to take it off the bill. \n\nI pay the bill,  and leave.  \n\nNever to return again.

We were stuck between flights, unaware at that point that our four-hour layover would end up lasting sixteen thanks to Air Canada's rubber band breaking on their flying yak.  Before realizing this fact, we took a break at Cabine M, and credit given for having a unique name.  Not sure what the M stands for, Montreal or Marcotte (found on their menu).  The d\u00e9cor was simple enough, and I liked the dividing wall offering some measure of privacy.  However, I doubt the wall of wine on the near wall has ever been opened.\n\nBeyond their simple menu, they also offer a chef's tasting page designed (apparently) by something called HMSHost, which I discovered later was some gigantic conglomerate responsible for menus and meals for other restaurants specialized in catering to travelers.  Why travelers needed their own specialized menu, I'll never know.  Apparently Cabine M (Marvel?) couldn't be bothered to design one on their own...I guess?  Odd that they'd call it a Chef's Tasting since obviously the chef on tap at Cabine M (Mancy?) had no hand in the creation of this menu.  Odd coincidence, HMSHost is owned by Autogrill, something I would get to know very well on my upcoming trip to Italy (the same one delayed).  \n\nSo yeah, we ordered the tasting menu.  For $26, it promised (apparently) four starter courses and your choice of one protein among three.  Sounds like a steal.  Here is where things get a little muddy: a tasting menu involves several plates over a long period.  What Cabine M (Math?) did was throw all five selections on a single plate and serve it all at once.  I ordered the rosemary grilled chicken breast.  The tasting starters promised a \"reversed nacho\", roasted asparagus, Caesar salad, and a chef's potato.  Let's call this out for what it was--a full page advertising a single plate of food.  Talk about pretentious.  The chicken breast was resting on the asparagus and potatoes, next to the salad with four tortillas resting in a small cup of salsa.  \n\nNo, you're right, squirting tube-fed salad dressing over uncut Romaine with three croutons on top equates avante garde.  Why the hell, did this plate require a page of detail?  It's one plate of food.  It wasn't bad, but holy crap, was that a lot of hype for what amounted to very little food.  I counted five potatoes the size of D&D dodecahedrons.  Three, count'em, three tortillas.  Three croutons over uncut Romaine.  Even the chicken wasn't very big, and this restaurant needed to outsource this page to a giant multi-national conglomerate?\n\nI don't think I have properly explained how exaggerated this plate was.  This entire offering required 55 words on its own isolated laminated page.  The nachos, asparagus, potatoes, and salad were each given their own paragraph with header and description.  Each possible alternate protein had its own suggested wine offering.  Not even posh bistros in downtown London have the gall to put this much effort into a single plate of food.  If it was stellar, an iconic upper echelon of gastronomic bliss, I could see about giving them a pass, but at the end of the day, it was simply okay.  I can't stand it when restaurants go the artsy fartsy approach to salad--uncut lettuce with squirted dressing, forcing me to make a mess with knife and fork in order to enjoy a simple salad.

For Gandhi, it was our first visit there in December 2005, after a long journey to Montreal. It was late, we were tired and hungry, and worse, indecisive about dinner. But we were rewarded for our choice of Gandhi by wonderful Indian food and, I swear, the best naan I've ever had.\n\nExperiences like that are the bane of diners - we go back trying to repeat them... in my case, trying to have that transcendent naan. I'm not sure it's happened, but in several visits since, we've been nothing but pleased by the delicious Indian food, and the capable, if aloof, service.\n\nYou can accuse restaurants in Old Montreal of offering only bottom-dollar tourist crap, and that charge sticks to a number of establishments. This isn't one of them. I saw one review from a few years ago that described the cuisine as \"British-Indian.\" It's appropriate for a menu that offers the range of dishes one expects from an Indian restaurant in North America - vindaloos, curries, biranyi, tandoori, bhajis, naan. I don't know true Indian food well enough to quibble about authenticity, but I can say that the flavors, to my palate, are calibrated and nicely balanced - and this seems to be part of the heart and soul of this precise cuisine.\n\nOver a few visits, we came to believe that a request for spicy food would never result in a level of spiciness that we enjoy. But our last two visits in December 2007 convinced us that the kitchen can deliver the spice when called upon.\n\nDesserts here taste pedestrian to me, but after eating as much as I do at Indian restaurants, it could be that I'm all tapped out, so if you've had good desserts here, say so and give some recommendations.\n\nGandhi expanded its space in 2007, approximately doubling the size of the restaurant.

I was glancing at the menus of various restaurants trying to make up my mind, when a charming horse carriage pulled up nearby and a rather loud driver announced to her passengers that Gandhi was the best Indian Restaurant in town - that settled it. \nAfter 30 minutes of shopping to fill my waiting time(!),  I returned when Gandhi opened for dinner and was surprised to see about 3-4 tables already occupied. I was dining alone, and appreciated that the staff let me pick my table. Gandhi has a very extensive menu and offers two portion sizes - something more restaraunts in the USA should emulate. As I was trying to pick my vegetarian dish, the place filled up remarkably quickly, and by about 6 pm, there was hardly an empty table in the main dining area! \nI loved my mixed vegetable dish. It was spicier than I'd asked for, but fabulous anyway! A great mix of freshness, authentic flavor and hearty but not too heavy.

Many indian places are cheap and pad the entree with veggies in place of the meat but not this place :) \nThe lamb was deliciously spiced and had no \"gamey\" flavor at all. I was pleasantly surprised when I took a bite and found pineapple in there! So strange but it worked to balance the other savory flavors of the dish.

The food was tasteless, boiled rice without a trace of onion, garlic, bell pepper or even salt...the black beans they seemed to be straight from the can and reheated, again no spicy flavor at all..the shark was more like canned tuna (as far as I know shark is a very expensive fish, so they should be charging more than 11 dollars for this so they can make some profit, which means that either they are losing money by serving shark, or the shark IS canned tuna)...the juices were watery, in substance and flavor, not a hint of sweetness, the only thing that we actually enjoyed were the tajadas (slices of fried ripe plantain, served with grated cheese).\n\nThe service was OK, I asked the waiter for tajadas and he had no clue of what I was ordering, which means he's not Venezuelan, but I must say that he was friendly even if a bit slow.\n\nUnfortunately this was not a happy culinary experience, I lived in Venezuela for several years and I know what Venezuelan food is like, an exotic mixture Spanish cuisine with tropical accents, lots of garlic, onions, bell pepper, aji dulce, cumin, annato, I know that rice is boiled with a bit of oil, garlic, salt and a bell pepper to give it some flavor, I know what caraotas (black beans) are like, and cazon means cazon, not canned tuna.

Highly recommended. Had a great time. Enjoy.", "I am originally from Los Angeles. I grew up on a diet of pretty much Mexican food and even after I moved away it is still my native/comfort food. I have been searching all over Montreal for something that would remind me of the little \"whole-in-the-wall\" places with great food that I ate at while growing up. This is the closest thing I've found to it in Montreal.\n\nThe food was excellent. I had the pulled beef which was very similar in taste and texture to barbacoa. I had them make a \"plate\" so I got to sample a little of their salad, rice, slab of cheese, black beans and plantains. The worst of that group was the rice. It was OK but the rest just melted in my mouth. I was instantly transported back to my youth.  Sort of like the scene from the movie Ratatouille where the food critic, Anton Ego, samples the ratatouille that Remy the rat (main character) has just made and is transported back to his childhood. While I am not as old as that character appears to be in the movie am not in my 20's either.\n\nI set at the little breakfast bar that passes for the shared eating are (with the falafel place) and savored every morsel. Each nibble was sort of a trip down memory lane for me. The tastes, while not exactly identical, were so similar that it was as though time had temporarily reversed. I didn't snap out of my trance until I went to stab the next tasty bite and realized almost nothing was left to spear with my fork. \n\nThe avocado sauce was tasty and of course I had to try the hot sauce. I grew up on very hot peppers and love them all if they have good taste. I don't like spicy without good flavor. The hot sauce had just enough kick to satisfy my spicy food craving. If you are a gringo, it might be a bit to spicy so try just a little at first.\n\nMy only complaints were the rice was nothing to get excited about and I wish there had been more plantains than the 3 I received. I even felt compelled to speak in Spanish to the person working behind the counter and comment; muy sabroso! So while my French may be my handicap here, my Spanish finally found a place worth using! I likely may be back every day while I am here."]}}, "ORbDFcH_mvupg_uQ2LeZ2g": {"reviews": {"3": ["Les plats \u00e9taient bons mais cela ne m'a pas enthousiasm\u00e9.\n\nMon poulet tikka massala \u00e9tait servi seulement avec de la sauce, aucun l\u00e9gume dans la sauce ce qui fut bien dommage.

They make their own tonic so my gin tonic was absolutely delicious! My friend had the tequila Bloody Caesar and couldn't even finish it, it was just awkward.\nWe got the calamari and the chicken wings for starters: the salad was fine nothing special, a bit stingy with the calamari (cooked pretty well) the chicken wings were so strange.

I will definitely give them another chance if they update their menu.", "Okay.. now I get it.. I am going to have to unfortunately update my review, changing this place from one of my potential favorites in Montreal, to one of the most dissapointing.. It turns out the one \"bad\" waitress from last time, was more of a taster of the norm than the other nicer server I managed to find that night.\n\nMy sister was visiting town last night, and previously when I went to Mais, I thought she'd love it, like me and my wife do, so I reserved to come here with her.  But from the second we arrived, though, even having reservations, we were just met with severe negativity and dismissive \"service\".. Almost every single thing, from \"Where is the bathroom?\" to \"Any other nice cocktails to have with food here other than margaritas?\" was met with serious disdain. The staffer would stop blank faced, kind of annoyed, mumble something dismissively, and walk off. And we were never sure if he heard or what or what.. And that's if they would answer. A couple times he just lifted his eyebrows in a \"whatever,\" way, no words, and then we'd sit and wait confused and maybe something would show up. It was hit or miss what showed up. About 2/3 of what we ordered.\n\nBut then later ordering our food (about an hour into our night), mid sentence from my sister, the guy just pulled away and walked off to the kitchen, we looked at each other confused wondering what just happened, I thought maybe something urgent he forgot.. but then he strolled out, leaned on the bar and joked with another girl server for like 2-3min at the bar, eventually I made eye contact with him gesturing with my hand like \"what's going on?\", he storms back over looking really annoyed now, so when I reminded him of our taco order, and if my sister could finish ordering her food he said something along the lines of, \"Obviously, or what you wanna make it yourself...?\" followed by some nondescript slur under his breathe. He tried to cover it up with a smile, but my sister was furious now about to stand up and lose it on this guy. If I wasn't such a patient person in service situations [I worked as a waiter many times in my life], I wouldve thrown fuel, but I just tried to ignore and gestured for her to not, but thought to myself, \"I'm never coming back here,\" and finished our order. My sister wanted to walk out right then and there, but I said give it a chance still. But the guy then proceeded to smugly slam everything down on the table from then onwards.\n\nThere was a very strange inferiority complex stemming from the wait staffers, anything we ordered was sort of met with this weird power struggle spite. There was definitely something going on, it wasn't a normal experience. But impossible to take in stride. Maybe the management/staff were in some kind of internal dispute or something, I dunno, we started to speculate, but that's not my job/role as a customer. \n\nNow. All that said, again, I must note that when the food came, all the tacos: fish, carnitas, others, & drinks were excellent. Really yummy, fresh & well priced. Kitchen/bartenders have got it down. But the wait staff made me feel like complete shit constantly, all of us. And by this point it was really kind of miserable, especially because I knew the bill was going to be well over $100 (I really wanted to have a great night with my sister/pay for all of us).\n\nAnyhow, eventually I asked the staffer what was wrong, or if we had done something, to which the guy smiled and exclaimed \"Nothing at all man, why?!\" very joyfully/off-guard. But then it just continued, so I think he was being sardonic in retrospect. Anyway, we figured maybe it was just the one guy (last time I had a hit/miss thing with the staffers too), maybe having a bad night, so I asked another wait girl, and weirdly she did almost the exact same!. Just the same angry face, disdainful treatment, an entirely \"fuck you customer\" experience. It was really disheartening. Just a two hour painful \"hospitality\" nightmare.\n\nWhen it came to the end, whatever \"it\" was, I asked for the bill. I left 0 tip. First time ever in my whole life. But it was the only way I knew how to express my anger without lowering myself to what they were doing. But sadly, I felt I was still well over a $100 short, and really really upset by the loss of money and horrible experience. Obviously the staff didn't say anything, because it was obvious how out of line their \"service\" was. \n\nI can never ever return here now. Even if I wanted to, the staffers have made it ethically impossible for me. And that is a real shame, because I loved it before. Bad service is one thing, but paying ppl to treat you like shit (especially as a high paying return customer with reservations) is just completely out of line (regardless of previous experiences). And it wasn't a busy night. The onus is totally on management to realize that they have ppl working for them that are actively destroying what should easily be a fantastic place."], "3": ["I'm a lover of Mexican food and always interested in supporting local businesses (plus I have a friend who works there and encouraged me to to check it out) so I was happy to discover Mais a few weeks back. \n\nI found it to be a cozy, bustling joint where it was easy to people-watch since most of the young crowd were seated at long picnic-like tables. I thought the tacos were artfully plated and had a few little twists. The ricotta-squash sounded the most interesting, but I personally found it bland and too rich. The Carnita was the winner for me - tender meat with crispy pork rind and salsa verde - and delicious paired with a Tecate. My vegetarian compadre seemed happy with her marguerita even though it was in a smurf-sized glass and she declared the fish taco trumped the mushroom/squash. There are vegetarian options yes...but I found them to be the weakest links on the menu. A spicy bean/smoked tofu would certainly make a nice addition...\n\nThere was little room for dessert (at only three tacos each and beverages we were stuffed) but we shared a home made chocolate bar (a dense, chocolate cookie bar). I liked the concept but the actual dessert left something to be desired. If it had been moister or glazed with a cinnamon-chocolate ganache it might have stood out. As it stood - it sat. \n\nYes, Mais is currently a hot spot.

Nice wine, exceptional desert, and premium product quality, homemade fries (I'm a sucker for those) and short, direct menu with a great team of cooks. They're fast, efficient and professional.\n\nI had the Onglet de Boeuf au beurre Maitre d'Hotel (shive and white wine butter). Onglet is live Bavette, quite  tasteful and pretty rare to find it in a restaurant and at your regular supermaket. I also had the Homemade rilette with some crouton. The quantity is generous and even if French Bistro tends to have small portion, I was well fed after my 2 meal courses, and a nice dessert: Chocolate Mousse, separated by thin nut-waffle and chocolate .\n\nWith a wine from Pays Basque, 77.50$ (with tip + wine + desert + 1 bottle of sprinkle water) really a great deal: I'm going back there for sure!\n\nPS: With the nice temperature, dont hesitate to seat on the nice patio that has a touch of intimacy.

I've been disappointed 3 times in a row by the quality of the food and the staff so I think this review is fair. In fact, the food and service is so consistently good when one of the owners, Paulino, is there that maybe I find out when his shift is and go back when he's working (like in totally normal, legit way; not a weird, stalker way). When the cat's away the mice will play, I guess. I'm not sure if it's just growing pains or what but it seems the newer staffers are inexperienced and really don't give a damn. My last experience at La Capital, I wanted a cocktail (something with tequila in it) but the waiter said I could have a shot of tequila and a beer - I asked for a Margarita (thinking that surely they could make a drink with lime and tequila) but the waiter said they didn't have the ingredients and offered me a grapefruit Jarritos and a tequila (maybe that's a thing? Grapefruit soda and tequila? but, NO THANKS). When I questioned not having tequila and lime in a Mexican restaurant the waiter asked me what the recipe was and that he'd make me one - yeah, A for effort there buddy but if you don't know the ingredients for a Margarita I don't want you making me one (for $10 no less). There were 3 of us dining - we had the intention of sharing the tacos but the food came out and we had no sharing plates. I requested hot sauce and the waiter pointed at the two bottles of salsa on the table (that is not what I had in mind but I let it go). My tacos had hair it in - I sent it back. HAIR. ACK! The waiter apologized and said they'd make me a new one BUT THEY LITERALLY REMOVED THE HAIR AND SENT ME BACK THE SAME PLATE... Unacceptable! Keep your hair out of my food, is that too much to ask?! Since we couldn't order cocktails we stuck to water - which was a mistake because our glasses were empty the entire time. The waiter never came back to ask us if we needed anything and we couldn't seem to flag anyone down. I also want to mention that we went at 1:30pm after the lunch rush so there is no good excuse for having trouble flagging down our waiter. Aside from our table there was a couple - that's it. It wasn't busy. We ended up eating off of the same taco plates by eating a taco and passing the plate with the remaining tacos along, which is really awkward when you are dining with co-workers. These aren't like close buddies - I think I accidentally ate something that fell out of my coworkers mouth. GROSS. I'm afraid the love affair is over. I'll probably go through a phase of eating a lot of tacos at meaningless taco joints until I find the right one and then a new love will blossom. I'm not so jaded to think that I won't find that one true taco place. The hope is alive.", "I visited this place back when it had first opened. I ordered from the lunch menu, and on the side it was written \"soup + drink\", so I asked the waitress if it was included with any of the lunch meals, and she said that they all came with soup and drink. I proceeded to order from said menu and got myself a drink from their daily special drink. It tasted like heavily diluted juice, basically water with a touch of flavor and coloring. Who cares, I thought to myself, at least I can enjoy the water. The surprise came when I had to pay the bill. Apparently the soup and drink together were a good 4-5$ extra and not included with the lunch deal.

After many days I was really craving tacos, which we eat all the time at home. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, and I was thrilled to see La Capital pop up on Yelp when I searched for nearby lunch finds. You wouldn't expect this restaurant to be nestled amongst the many pho and ramen places or Asian food markets, but it's there and it's wonderful.\n\nIt's ultra casual inside and pretty crowded at lunch time. Concrete floors, big heavy tables, and a tiny bar space (although they don't serve any alcohol as of now). They're got fresh squeezed juice on the menu, and then their speciality - authentic tacos. Chicken, fish, carnitas, steak, al pastor... the classics. We started with the chips and guacamole, which were wonderful. The chips are pretty dark and initially looked like they might be over-fried, but they tasted great. The guacamole was delicious as well, and super fresh. There are 3 different types of salsa in little plastic squeezy bottles... I believe my favorite was the green/verde, which was super-fresh, cool, and cilantro-y.\n\nWe also ordered a side of refried beans which I LOVED. Amazing authentic flavor with just the right amount of cheese on top. We decided on the 3 plate al pastor tacos for our entree. Our waitress actually forgot to put in our order, and we waited for quite awhile before we realized and asked her to double check. She was super apologetic and even brought us one extra taco free of charge. I was happy because the tacos were delicious. The meat was incredibly tender and the fresh pineapple is always a beautiful accompaniment. Plus, the corn tortillas appeared to be homemade - wonderful texture and just the right thickness.\n\nBe prepared to wait for a seat right at lunchtime. Chinatown is already super busy with tourists, and this restaurant is one-of-a-kind in the neighborhood! I think it'd be worth the wait, however. One of my favorite places during our trip.", "I have to hand it to this Mexican restaurant for opening up in China town. Great restaurant with fresh ingredients. I mean the guacamole is exactly how I love it, not too minced and has small chunks of avocado. The rib eye taco is my favourite and that sauce that comes with it makes me want to eat them until I explode. The sauce is a blend of jalape\u00f1o, garlic and some other magical ingredients that I can't remember. The shrimp taco was decent, I didn't like the mayo in it but that is just me because I am picky. Overall it is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the city. Only dock is it is a little pricey, but the quality is there. I will definitely be back.", "If there's one simple food everyone loves it is a taco. Starting a taco joint may seem easy, but it takes attention to detail to really perfect the taco. La Capital - in the middle of Montreal and, funnily enough, Chinatown - has chosen to pay attention to detail and is rewarded with some marvelous little tacos. The al pastor is TRUE al pastor, meaning it's cooked on a spit. As a Texan who lives in a jungle of mexican restaurants, finding one that cooks al pastor the true way is surprisingly difficult. It says a lot to put al pastor on your menu and then not cheat!!\n\nThe salsas were tasty, the juice of the day is very authentic to mexican cuisine, and the space is small but refined in that taco joint kind of way.

We were speaking English to one another but all of us are fluent in French. Upon entering the very crowded and cramped restaurant at 8:25, we were told that our table wasn't ready yet. There were no seats for the 6 of us and we had no choice but to stand in the narrow passageway between tables, making it difficult for the servers to pass and unintentionally uncomfortably hovering over customers who were already seated.\n\nBy 8:45, our table still wasn't ready, and upon inquiring, the hostess said that the party was taking a long time to eat and she couldn't do anything about it. She added that there was a note in our reservation that we'd be willing to wait, which she was sure to point out by the word \"dattendre\" under our name on the screen. We were told there could be a five minute wait upon making the reservation, not a half hour wait! Finally, we left the restaurant at 9:00, but it is certainly not easy to find space for 6 people on Bernard without a reservation.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after leaving, we received a call saying our table was now ready and returned to Les Enfants Terribles. As the busboy was setting the table with wine glasses, the waiter said in French \"no wine glasses for them, they won't be needing them\" as if we didn't understand. Three of us did in fact order cocktails (at $12 a glass, may I add,) but two of the drinks had no alcohol whatsoever in them. When we told the waiter there was no alcohol in them, he didn't even deny it, and instead said \"I'll get you a new one.\"\n\nAs the waiter was taking our orders, I told him that we had waited over half an hour for our table and said I hope something could be done. When he returned, he said that he was told that we were told that there would be a wait and consequently there was nothing that could be done. There was no apology whatsoever and the blame seemed to be put on us. This is absolutely absurd, given that we were told that there could be a 5 minute wait, not over a 30-minute one. That long a wait is simply unacceptable for any establishment, much less a restaurant with Les Enfants Terribles' jacked-up prices.\n\nThe food itself was good, and once we were seated, the service was prompt. Nevertheless, one could find the same quality of food for a cheaper price elsewhere in the city, and certainly with better service.\n\nOverall, it was a \"terrible\" experience (pun intended). I sincerely hope that the management of Les Enfants Terribles reads this review and realizes that a paying customer is a paying customer, whether they are young or old or speak English or French, and deserve to be treated with the same amount of respect.

I'm a sucker for mini, chorizio and pogo!) with their accompanying mustard dipping sauce. \n\nPrices were more than reasonable. \n\nStaff was very good - very professional and courteous and just the right amount of attention. \n\nI love the little details - wine glasses with child's finger prints and tshirts that read \"je suis un enfant terrible\" - they have merch!\n\nI'm looking forward to trying out their brunch."], "5": ["Great place, great food and great ambiance. One of the best patios in town for summer. This place is right across from Outremont theater where all the top French troupes from Paris come to perform. Naturally they come to chill at this restaurant after the show.

While the previous dump (Vasco da Gama?) circled the drain with its overpriced crappy sandwiches and holier-than-thou attitude, whoever owns this place now was plotting to open one bistro in Outremont to end them all.\n\nAnd what an opening- gorgeous decor accented by driftwood-like beams studding the walls, iron, shades of grey mixed with black and white, all very HGTVish, but done with extreme taste. On summer nights the terrace wraps around the corner and the ambience is absolutely top-notch. The patrons are a total motley crew - everything from pipe-smoking faux-Parisian Outremont snobs, to 50-something MILFs having one too many with their real estate coworkers, to Moroccan guys in their mid-30's with white belts and matching 'crocodile' Aldo shoes. A total melange, and yet it works somehow.  \n\nAnd what about the food, you ask? No one cares. Who needs a killer menu with so many other assets? And yet, the food is not bad. I mean, it's not going to win any awards - but go tell that to the million people lining up every weeknight to snatch a seat outside. That being said, the tartare and good old bistro-burger are excellent, and the breakfast is pretty good, too.\n\nThis place is a real treat.

Let's just say, a very cool mix of nice wood tables on a more modern backdrop. Very nicely done. I agree that this may not be the best place for an intimate dinner, but that is not the type of place it is. You have more than enough space at your table, but it is a lively and vibrant restaurant so you need to be up for that. \n\nThe food is very good, vegetables are fresh. It isn't an artisanal menu, but what they do, they do well.\n\nBut really, the thing I love about this place is the service. I was there this morning and, despite being very busy, the wait-staff was patient and smiling. Our waitress came by multiple times with the coffee, and was incredibly patient with my indecisiveness (sorry again about that). This only follows on similar previous experiences - I have come with my friend and her two young children before. The waiter brought over colors and coloring paper and was great with the kids despite their... activity. On yet another visit, we sat outside on a slightly chilly night and the waitress brought some of the girls shawls to warm up.\n\nReally, the fact that these guys manage to maintain the level of service they do at such a trendy and bustling restaurant is impressive. Many thanks, I'll definitely be back!"]}}, "g2tqRwPWHCWtr_SEEAECoQ": {"reviews": {"1": ["I'm always on the lookout for a cool place to get good eats during my lunch hour at work. One of my coworkers introduced me to Le Cartet, apparently the cat's meow of a fine foods market doubling as a gourmet restaurant.\n\nAt first glance, one's appetite comes alive just by looking at the restaurant/food store. The setting is absolutely gorgeous. It has the feel of an American general store from an old mill town, fused with a very modern feel. Every little detail has been exhaustively looked over by a very crafty team of designers. The staff is meticulously dressed and hired to look the part the restaurateurs desired. No Saran Wrap here, it's a fine plastic wrapping you would find in a flower shop to pack roses. The facing of the product is immaculate. The table settings are just inviting and warm. It just reeks of Old Montreal Goodness. Local stars and Olympic athletes can be spotted grabbing a bite there.\n\nIt just looks perfect.\n\nEmphasis on the \"looks\". Sometimes a cake is crap but the icing makes it look good enough to eat anyway. And Le Cartet is such an example.\n\nLet me take you through the culinary ordeal I went through. Let's begin with the salad entr\u00e9e I took. A simple looking salad, which is the way it should be to kick-start one's digestion properly. It comes with a vinaigrette de Provence. Unless you have unclean or not so fresh lettuce, the dressing makes or breaks the salad. When I say Provence, if you enjoy wine, a nice wine-based dressing will most likely come to mind. Certainly not chili peppers, which are from Central and South America. Well, the dressing was made up of mostly chili peppers. Not being a lover of spicy foods (I feel spices take away the tastes of the food I'm eating) I immediately put aside the spice-ridden salad because it was awful.\n\nNext in my meal was a simple egg salad sandwich on rye bread. I should spell that drye bread. It was too dry even for a corned beef sandwich. But wait, it gets worse. How they accomplished this is beyond me, but the egg salad was also dry. A good mayonnaise should be tangy and moist; I couldn't taste anything of the sort other than flat, boring mayonnaise. Throw in some herbs at least or some garlic, give it some punch. And the piece of Romaine lettuce still had the heart attached to it. It was big enough to choke someone. But since I had to eat something and I wasn't about to dole out another fifteen dollars for lunch, I finished the sandwich, washing it down with water so it could pass my oesophagus; yes it was that damn dry. \n\nBut that's not all. Since it was my first run at the restaurant I even treated myself to some dessert -- a lovely Tarte Tatin. This, for the uninitiated, is good ol' apple pie from France -- basically your regular apple pie but with the top caramelised with butter and sugar. Caramelised, not carbonised into extinction. When I took my first bite, hoping that the dessert would save me from this so far revolting experience, I cringed when I smelled the charred layer of burnt sugar and it was too late. The final straw.\n\nThe only thing that tasted okay was the water -- the one in the Evian bottle.\n\nThe problem with gourmet restaurants is that they fear the fat -- if you want taste, you must embrace the fat. It's what makes food taste good, end of story. Slap on some butter, some cream, or some punchy mayonnaise. The fat is the drummer of the food band. If you ain't got the beat, if you ain't got the rhythm, it's all for naught.\n\nThe restaurant gets a point for impeccable presentation and none for anything else. A big fat one out of five. Want good French cuisine in Old Montreal?  For lunch, stick to Cluny's, and put a cross over Le Cartet.", "Buyer beware!!\n\nI will not be back...not because the food was bad, but because I am too frugal.  \n\nI ordered granola with soy milk (because I am lactose intolerant and couldn't do the yogurt) and fruit dish plus coffee.  It cost about $14.  I had to get another breakfast beacuse it wasn't enough food.  \n\nSo, it was tasty, but NOT FILLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had half a cup of granola at that!  They also charged me $0.75 more for a tiny thing of soy milk even though the yogurt is more expensive.  Go figure and go broke.\n\nPotatoes are cooked in duck fat.  \n\nTotal bill was $40 for 2 of us.", "Long wait at 11:45 am on a Saturday, accompanied by expensive (yet terrible) food. Would never come back. Not sure why so many people are willing to wait. For god's sake, walk 10-15 minutes to Olive et Gourmando instead. Worst brunch I've had in a long time. Why is this so highly rated on Yelp!?!"], "2": ["I want to be able to give this fresh place more stars, so maybe I'll go back and try again- but based on the brunch I had last Saturday, this is the most deserving rating.  It looks great when you walk in~ fresh food displayed, great decor.  The menu is diverse for brunch.  My friend got an egg dish and latte which she really enjoyed. \n\nI on the other hand had my mouth water over their Banana Coconut (french) Toast with Yogurt and fruit.  It looked good when it came (~5min after my friends dish), however the top toast was lukewarm and the bottom refridgerator cold bananas throughout the cold toast.  I asked the server if it was supposed to be cold and she apologized and took it away.  Only to return a few minutes later with the Same one I tried before, now pipping hot and soggy ~ I suspected microwave- and asked if that was the case. She said no, but  they would now make me a fresh one.  Surprised that didn't happen initially.  Much to my surprise, a \"fresh\" one arrived burnt! not just a little either...  Done with sending it back I ate around the most burnt pieces.  Coconut torched is not the most pleasant taste.  Maybe this was an anomaly, but surprised that this was my experience.  The good thing is that the waitress was very friendly and nice- but the kitchen was off for my dish.", "Meant to eat breakfast here, but didn't get there until breakfast had finished (although the signs all seemed to say we had another hour before breakfast closed...).  I'm guessing the breakfast would still be great, but the lunch was really disappointing.  It wasn't bad per se, but wasn't better than anything I make in my own kitchen (I got the ham and cheese sandwich - very boring, my husband got an overpriced quiche that was very similar and not better than one I make at home).  Coffee was fantastic though, and the ambiance was pretty cool.  Wait staff seemed annoyed at our existence, and although we're annoying, I don't think we gave them enough to know that.  Overall, maybe it's as good as they say for breakfast, but I would definitely say skip this one for lunch.", "VIBE \nThe decor at Le Cartet is awesome. Cool castor-esque light bulbs hang down from the ceilings. Cool cut outs of maps are on the wall and big pots of poinsettas are in the back. I can see it's a buzzy type of place for brunch/lunch.

We figured it must be good if this many people are lining up, so we stuck it out for ~30-45 mins. despite being really hungry! I can't say they manage the line that well. There's a long line and it took me a while to figure out that it was for the coffee/tea counter (you can get a drink to sip on while  you wait). I was confused if it was only a take-out line or not. I stood there for a while, then someone took my name down and added it to a list. We had to awkwardly hang around the boutique section at the front of the restaurant while we waited (mmm, everything there looks so tasty... fancy olive oils, Kusmi teas, pre-made salads...). \n\nI can see why it's popular -- the decor is very understated-chic and the communal tables are nice. Food-wise, I expected more and price-wise, I wouldn't say they offer great value (brunch plates $15-16). I had the brunch Cartet which was huge. I liked that it came with a big salad. The croissant with ham and goat cheese was yummy. The scrambled eggs were kind of cold and the salmon was just ok.

For some reason, such a simple order took more than half an hour to arrive, while the people behind us with large groups and large meals were served before us. Our waitress made rare appearances.

As we waited to be seated (about 5 minutes before any acknowledgement), we looked at the specials of the night. Nothing fancy, half price Sangrias and Bud, and 13.95 fish and chips.  Once we were seated, we got our food and drinks relatively fast. Then the night turned again.  With the fish and chips, we had hoped for some ketchup, after trying desperately to get the attention of a waitress, we had to get up and ask for some.  By this point we had eaten all our fish, and salad, and drank most of our pitcher of Sangria.  The waitress rolled her eyes when I asked for Ketchup, and brought it to us after another 5 minutes or so.  We then sat around for at least half an hour, trying to get a waitresses attention for the bill.  We finally had to get up and hunt her down. (Probably could've dashed...) We got the bill, but were charged the usual price for the fish and chips (16.00, only 2.05 more, I know, but it's the principle you know, especially with the service) I didn't want to make a big deal of it, so I just rolled with it, and paid the exact amount without tip, since I felt I could have done a better job had she told me where to pick up my food.  So she chases after us, and says \"the tip is not included\" we reply with \"we know, the service was awful, and you didn't serve us well\" her response to that was \"that doesn't matter, you have to tip at least 4%, or two dollars\" my response was then \"well charge me 13.95 for the fish, and that 2 dollar difference is yours\" and stormed away.  How rude of her.\n\nSo, overall, good location, edible food, godawful service.", "Okay, its been awhile since I wrote a review but there are some places that you can just never forget.  There are places so memorable that they are forever etched in your mind. La Grande Terrasse is one such place. And its so memorable why ?  Because it truly sets the bar for bad service....and the food is not much better. Let me start by saying I love Canada, I practically hum the Canadian National Anthem in my sleep.  When I visit Canada I am always a bit unsure of just where to eat because of the whole language barrier thing and some times I take chances.  They usually work out, but not this one.  The restaurant is in a great location right in Jacques Cartier Square in the heart of Old Montreal.  I went with my wife and a couple friends but unfortunately when we were seated it was also in a location directly in the 90 degree sun. So when the waiter finally graced us with his presence (after ignoring us for about 15 minutes) I quickly ordered an overpriced Bud Light Lime.  After another fifteen minutes of involuntary tanning my beer arrived as well as some water for the rest of the table.  The waiter then left again so we could have some (more) time to read the menu and continue browning. By the time our waiter made it back to the table the other tables around us had all been served meals.  One of the meals had apparently been so good that the guests demanded thier money back and they wanted to immediately see a manager. Good luck with that,  I was still waiting for a sighting of my waiter. While we waited we had plenty of time to watch the sparrows dive in from above and eat the scraps from the patio floor.  Another nice touch was the wasps flying around everyone's head. There is nothing like some biting stinging insects to really add some ambiance to the experience. So after sitting for about 40 minutes we finally got to order some food.  The menu was rather uninspiring but we were all so hungry that at that point we didn't even care. Our friends ordered Poutine with Vegetables, and A Sunshine Salad (somewhat appropriate considering where we were sitting).My wife also ordered Poutine, and I ordered the Steak Steak French Bread Sandwich with a side of Poutine. About another twenty minutes and all the food arrived. My side of Poutine was almost the same size as the entr\u00e9e portions at the rest of the table.  Not only were the portions small but the Poutine was also not that good. The fries were frozen and that always just kind of depresses me.  Mine was also not very hot, and the gravy was forgettable.  The Steak Steak sandwich was mostly vegetables and tasted like roasted red peppers and half cooked onion more then anything else. Perhaps it should have been called a Veggie Veggie sandwich instead. What I did taste of steak tasted somewhat old and frost bitten.  On the bright side, the French bread was actually pretty good.  I didn't dare ask my friend about how her salad was...but it looked like a salad, and was probably more of a meal then the entr\u00e9e portions of Poutine that the others had.  Of course the waiter took his time getting the check to us,  and when he did the bill was not split correctly amongst us. At that point none of us cared so we quickly paid and hit the road, running, as fast as we could never to return."], "2": ["Finding a place for a large-ish group to eat at 9.30 on a Thursday night isn't the easiest thing to do.

Too early for burgers, I settled on a tasty diner breakfast: two pancakes, three strips of bacon (the pig wasn't so lucky), two eggs (those poor unborn chickens), potatoes, toast and coffee, all for about thirteen dollars, including the tip.  Not bad at all!  Also, I was in and out in about forty-five minutes, which left me with plenty of time for a last minute trip to Simon's before checking out and beginning the long drive back to Boston.\n\nSo, all you buckaroos and buckarettes, if you're looking for a diner that opens early, serves good food at a reasonable price with friendly, quick service, give Mister Steer a shot--but not literally, of course.\n\nYee haw!", "Fairly standard burger and fries joint with no frills to other.

In my case, I had a simple cheese burger, which came with a side-salad and some Suzy-Qs fries, which essentially are curly fries which have a light seasoning on them.\n\nEverything came out reasonably quickly from the kitchen and the burger was cooked perfectly and was somewhat juicy. The fries on the other hand weren't that great and the salad... well... was a fairly standard salad.\n\nI walked in not expecting much and got exactly that. My experience there was decent and the service was efficient, although not that friendly. Seems to me like this place is a tourist trap, especially since it's on St. Catherine's Street. The place was clean, the menu had a wide variety of items and the only catch is that it was cash-only which was kind of annoying, especially since it's 2011. \n\nWith many more places to eat in the area, I'd stay away from this place as there's much better around, except if you want a burger in which case they do a pretty decent job.

Mind you we were a table of 3. \n\nNow we were getting suspicious. Why is this waiter pushing a 100/pp special when it clearly looks like we can eat well for around $80/pp including wine? I know why, because its Grand Prixe weekend and they want to make money. \n\nAt this point we wanted to walk out because we felt like we were being forced to order the special. We didn't leave, but we should have.\n\nInstead, we ordered a few appetizers and some steaks (much to the waiters dismay): sirloin, hanger, and ribeye. The steaks were barely competent. The ribeye was good I won't lie, but the hanger and sirloin had a burnt taste on the outside. The inside was cooked fine but you couldnt get rid of the charred taste with each bite. Hardly enjoyable. \n\nNow onto the last irritating part of the night. We ordered a $40bottle of red to start. When we asked to see the wine menu again for the second bottle, the waiter recommended a $95 bottle as a good choice. It was clear at this point that this guy clearly had no clue how to read his guests and was just interested in the restaurant making money during Grand Prixe weekend. Not to mention his face dropped when we opted to go with another $40 bottle since that was clearly our price range. His relatively out of place suggestion and subsequent disappointment was inappropriate and rude. \n\nBottom line about this place, it's a steakhouse that isnt't very good at making steak and they really know how to make you feelike an a$$.

Previously, the incredibly modern setting made sense - DNA was known for its experimental but always delicious haute cuisine.\n\nUpon entering Atelier d'Argentine, I was surprised to see that not much has changed - not even to suit the style and feel of an Argentinean steakhouse. Same glass partitions, same industrial lighting, same steel d\u00e9cor. Hmmm.\n\nIn any case, I heard so much about this restaurant through social media and was excited to finally try it. A delicious piece of red meat is always welcome in my carnivorous diet!\n\nWe started with the fennel, watercress, citrus and sugar-roasted almond salad. It was delicious! So fresh, with great contrasting textures and just the right amount of dressing. Good start.\n\nNext, we both chose the grilled hanger steak with chimichurri & criolla sauce. A medium-rare, properly prepared hanger steak can be an amazing-tasting piece of meat. It also doesn't need much fuss around it - usually salt and pepper are just enough to enhance the taste.  Unfortunately, this hanger steak wasn't so great. The cut was sub-par and the taste was... Seriously MIA. Here, the lack of spice really brought out the bland and somewhat stringy piece of meat. The chimichurri wasn't bad but the dish, on the whole, was unfortunate.\n\nFinally, we split the caramel stuffed crepes with honey roasted walnuts, saut\u00e9ed bananas and milk semifreddo. Like the hanger steak, the dessert was unimpressive and lacked finesse. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.\n\nIt seems that Atelier d\"Argentine is going through a bit of an identity crisis. It's trying to be a serious restaurant - occupying DNA's space leaves them with large shoes to fill - but it's also trying to be \"fly\" and \"happening\". On Thusday night, the restaurant hosts its \"Besame\" event: after 10pm, their menu becomes less expensive and the party atmosphere heats up. I'm not saying Atelier d'Argentine is attempting the impossible, but it's trying to do too much too fast.

Grilled with only sea salt, we were explained that pepper would overpower the subtle intricacies of the cut of meat. Ridiculously tender, we were able to cut through the steak like a screaming hot knife through butter. The skirt steak - a classic gaucho cut of beef - was grilled with salt and pepper then finished with coarse salt. Mixed with its own juices, the salt created a briny sheen to the steak which made it glisten and begged to be devoured.

Although there are many variants, La Chilenita, opened 6 years ago, probably produces the best Chilean Empanadas in town! \n\nI tried the \"La Chilena\", apparently the most popular choice, with its traditional filling which includes beef, onions, black olives, and a slide of a hard boiled egg. The lunch special came with a hearty lentil soup for $6.99! Also available by the unit, 1/2 dozen or dozen, you can order your a choice of 6 meat and 5 vegetable fillings!\n\nIf you stop by for lunch, there's also your usual mexican fare including tacos, quesadillas, chimichanga, salads and burritos.

Considering they make the empanadas in such bulk (they literally have hundreds in their display case at a time), it would be nice if they were a *tad* cheaper, but they're otherwise pretty affordable. The staff is pretty friendly.

Everything from flattening out the dough to wrapping them up. \n\nLa Chilenita has a great variety of fillings for their empanadas, and about half are vegetarian. So far I've tried 3 kinds and they've all been delicious. I've also tried their churrasco sandwich, which was amazing, too. I may just have to try their burrito next.\n\nFor about $6 you can have a great lunch at La Chilenita , but unfortunately they close at 6pm (at least on weekdays).

In India they have samosas. In Turkey, they have borek. In Latin America, they have empanadas.\n\nLa Chilenita is ground zero if you want empanadas done right. Mind you there are regional differences among South American countries and how they make their empanadas (Argentines for instance fill their's with more meat). Here the Chilean varieties are served and with 13 different varieties, vegetarians and omnivores alike can both be happy and both kinds are delicious here.\nThe people who run the place here are very friendly and it's a great place to pick up a snack on the go. Why even bother with fast food joints like McDonald's when you have places like La Chilenita instead?", "FINALLY!  My dad was from Chile so I grew up eating Chilean empanadas.  Since his passing over two years ago, I have been on the hunt for the most authentic empanadas and this place absolutely nailed it! \n\nThe dough is just like my dad's and the beef filling is the most authentic I have tasted, and I have tried just about everywhere.  This place is small, just a few tables.  Service is friendly and fast.  Great lunch deal for $6 and some change...empanada of your choice and a soup or salad.  Very filling, totally hits the spot.  \n\nIt's a block or two off of St. Laurent, a little off the beaten path but definitely worth the small detour.  This place is a real gem.

The restaurant itself is dark and depressing with terrible colours and decor. Our server started off polite enough, but then as the meal progressed, he seemed irritated and quite short tempered. We ordered the Dal and Pakora to start. My Pakora was mildly seasoned and seemed to have been made far earlier and then just mildly heated up. The sauce that came with it was obviously watered down and all in all left me with an unpleasant taste. The Dal wasn't so bad, but it was the entrees that really upset us. We ordered a Butter Chicken and Chicken Korma. These are pretty basic dishes that are hard to mess up, at least that's what you would think. Wrong. They were far too sweet, sickly sweet and had zero spice, zilch, not even the tiniest hint of anything but sweetness. I ended up just eating some naan and waiting for our server to appear with  the bill. That ended up taking forever, funny since we were the only customers. Then when I went to pay, he messed up the transaction, had to get his boss to fix it.

Turns out it was, predictably, just as bland and unremarkable as its film namesake.\n\nFirst off, they delivered a flyer around the neighbourhood that said all orders were 10% off AND tax (15%) included for pick-up order. Upon inquiry, the latter was \"no longer valid\". If there's a printing mistake, a restaurant should honour the better of the two discounts, at least.\n\nSecond, they're one of \"those places\" that take credit cards, but not debit.

The folks working there seem friendly enough, but their joy is not derived from a pride in their cooking.\n\nMy advice to the owners: When you're not a super busy place, and a new client responds to your advertising, you need to do your best to woo their business, long-term. Your specials/combinations should be representative of the very best you have to offer, so that someone who order on impulse will plan to come back for a more involved meal.

I wanted to have a romantic night in, and order from a place that served great food. They don't offer delivery, but I came across their listing on a la carte express. So I placed the order on the alce website. I spent over $140 on a dinner for two, and it was the worst mistake of life. For starters, they forgot to pack one of my salads that I paid for. The salad was $9.\n\nI also believe that the food was out for delivery for a very long time. It was supposed to arrive at 7, and came at 7:20. I would estimate the food had been packaged sitting in a car for over an hour. Also the delivery man was a complete jerk...but they can't necessarily be blamed for that.\n\nThey have a t-bone steak that is almost $40. I ordered it, because I saw a picture on their website of a steak that looked delicious, served with a mushroom sauce and plentiful side dishes - hoping that would be the steak that came. Either way, how can a steak be bad? What came was a large, tough, room temperate steak, covered in montreal steak spice. This was in fact the worst steak I have ever eaten. They also didn't even bother to package it properly. It arrived in a pizza box! No wonder it was room temperature. It was a large t-bone steak, but probably the cheapest one they could find.\n\nI ordered 2 of their homemade pasta dishes (tagliatelli and linguini), and they must have sat in the plastic container for over 50 minutes. When the pasta arrived, I dumped it into the plate and it still retained the shape of the box. The moisture combined with the length of time it was in the container fused all of the strands of pasta into a solid glutinus lump.\n\nI ordered 2 dishes from their mozarella bar. These luckily, are supposed to be served at that temperature. However I'm not sure what the delivery man was doing with the parcel, but it looked as though someone filled a tuperware with mozarina di bufala and shook it vigerously for 5 minutes. The mozarina released all it's its juices in the container, it was smashed, and was almost like a soup.\n\nFinally the tiramisu. This tiramisu is made with very little mascarpone, and very little if any custard. It's essentially lady fingers, whip cream, and cocoa powder. It had no flavour, and it was actually frozen when it arrived. They may have thought it would have defrosted on the way, but no. I find it despicable for an italian restaurant to make their tiramisu so far in advance they have to freeze it and slice it. Tiramisu should be made early in the morning, or the night before, and chilled in the refrigerator. NOT put in the freezer. It was like eating ice cream with bread in it. Only ice cream would have had a better flavour.\n\nI ordered grilled octopus, the flavour was good, but they overdid it with the olive oil. It must have had at least 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\n\nIn the end the meal was room temperature and frozen, and not satisfying. I won't be spending my money here again. I definitely will not bother going into the restaurant either. \n\nNot sure if the problem was with alce, or the restaurant themselves, but the meal was not worth the price.

The Chicken Burrito Grande was tasty, but the way it was assembled lended to more of a knife-and-fork style than a standard eat-with-your-hands style I'm accustomed to. \n\nThe Steak Taco wasn't as good.

Sadly, it was just another blandish Taco, topped with Tomato (ack!) and Avocado. One thing it had going for it though, was an interesting innovation in cheese technology. Instead of sprinkling shredded cheese atop the taco as a topping, the cheese was introduced by being melted between 2 tortillas like a small grilled cheese sandwich. Pretty sweet, actually.

He said he liked it.\n- Veggie Burrito (see attached photo):  The burrito was delicious.  It is served on top of a salsa sauce which makes the burrito even tastier.\n- Churros: This was terrible.

Armed with an umbrella provided by the Fairmont, I arrived at the restaurant within 10 minutes, a bit wet and famished.\n\nAt the door I hesitated to enter, not because of the menu, but because I could see only one occupied table. Still, the promise of pasta overruled my trepidation.

I ordered the cream of mushroom soup and, though the sauce would be similar, I decided on one of the signature dishes: pasta Cibo with a cream sauce, mushrooms, prosciutto, and green onions. When the waiter took my order, he asked what type of pasta I'd like, which was a pleasant surprise. I opted for fettucini.\n\nMy generous bowl of soup arrived a short while later, along with a delicious freshly baked/warmed roll. The soup reminded me of a cream of mushroom that I once made from scratch years ago. There was a good depth of flavor, and the soup had just a hint of cream. It was perfect for a rainy night, and I had to prevent myself from finishing the whole bowl.\n\nBy then the other diners had departed, so I had the entire restaurant to myself and settled in to decide on plans for my visit to Montreal. After a short wait, my pasta arrived. Even in the low light, I could see a nice yellowness to the pasta. When I asked the waiter later if the pasta had been made in house, he said yes. It had that silky texture but toothsomeness that only comes with homemade pasta. The fettucine, bathed lightly in a rich cream sauce, was studded with chunks of prosciutto, slices of mushrooms, and slivers of green onion. The waiter had offered me some fresh pepper, and it really enhanced the flavors of all the other ingredients. Unfortunately, I was too full to finish the entire pasta--though I gave it a good try--and I also skipped dessert. \n\nAs I surveyed the empty restaurant, I hoped that it was usually far busier.

The food was delicious, quickly made and well priced - my three favorite qualities in a restaurant.\n\nMy pesto cream sauce on penne was just perfect. It was clear from the first bite the pasta was made in house and it was cooked to the perfect \"al dente\" consistancy. My cream sauce was velvety smooth and well seasoned. Don't even get me started on the garlic bread.\n\nBeing the only customers there, the waiter was very attendant. Even the chef came from his kitchen to ask how our meal was. It made for a very cosey, intimate atmosphere not unlike that scene from Lady & the Tramp (minus the neck bibs. Also minus the part about being dogs.)\n\nI give Cibo & Vino a 4 star and not a 5 star only because it can never take the place of Anton's (in Vancouver BC) as the best Italian I've ever eaten.\n\nSo if you too just wandered out of the Queen Elizabeth hotel, iPhone in hand, do yourself a favor: bypass the glitzy overrated Ruben's Deli and partake in some classic Italian fare instead.

As for the main course, I ordered their Penne Cibo, which I assume is their signature pasta which includes a wine and cream sauce with mushrooms, shallots and prosciutto. I enjoyed my plate of pasta very much and even used the last of my bread to mop up the sauce in my plate.\n\nIn the end, we were all pleasantly surprised with how good this place was.

I receive this chi-chi looking burger with a tear-jerking beautiful onion rings. So I jump on the rings and they made me want to believe in god. They were that good. Then I reluctantly went for that burger looking up at me from the plate, all glissenny, oozing with demi-glac\u00e9, onions holding on for dear life to the sandwich...\n\nI touch the bun... it had to be the warmest, softness bun I ever touched. I decided to pick up the burger, fearing great disappointment... SURVEY SAYS.... X. Seriously I was WRONG, very WRONG. It was hot, fresh, dribbling with onions and shrooms pooling in my plate with demi-glac\u00e9 and fat. It was overwhelmingly good... AWESOME really. It was rich, wet, fatty and overloaded with taste. Perfect bun, perfect patty, perfect toppings. Rings you would sell your grandma into slavery to get. Oh and Coca-Cola in a glass bottle.\n\nWorth going back to again and again. There's also desserts and one of my favourite fast food items, Milkshakes... MILKSHAKES. Having this place 7 minutes away from work is both a gift and downright EVIL. I strongly recommend it if you love a big hot meaty cheesy sandwich filled with goodness.\n\nI mean can you top eating a delicious burger with Sweet Emotions playing in the background? I think not.\n\n5 outta 5", "Loved this place! The minimalist decor reminds me of a New York city type eatery. They have beer on tap or bottle, and quite an interesting variety of burgers. My burger was AMAZING!!! I asked for a side of guacamole and mayo and they had no problem accommodating my request. The sweet potato fries were incredibly good. The service was attentive and friendly. If you're really in the mood for dessert, try the chocolate shake--it's perfect!", "Hello, my name is Loli and I believe I have fallen in love with the Burger Bar. It all started one afternoon when my dear lumberjack and I had a lovely time walking through Mont Royal. We mainly stopped for a drink and a quick snack before hopping on the Metro.\n\nOnce inside, I knew we had chosen well. The background music was just that- background music, the decor was simple but trendy, and I saw the food being served at another table. (Only my sternly engraved manners kept me from helping myself to their food. The burgers looked fantastic!)\n\nSince we were only there for a snack- we ordered the soup du jour (an onion soup) and a grilled chorizo potato salad to share. The soup was fantastic! It was everything that a french onion soup should be and proved to be very difficult to share. The grilled chorizo potato salad with corn was a delightful mix of tastes. I am not ashamed to admit how giddy I was to feel the crunch of green onions in my bites. Green onions + potatoes+ chorizo = lots of Loli's mouth happiness\n\nI am only sorry that I live so far away and that the Burger Bar and I cannot be married. I would be such a happy Loli if I could enjoy this much goodness everyday- but alas, it cannot be.

The whole night was a disaster! We ordered and 45 minutes later, still no food. We tell our waitress and instead of apologizing, she bluntly said \"Let me check what time I punched in the orders,\" as if we were lying. She comes back and tells us that we ordered 40 minutes ago. By then, we were ready to leave! The front manager comes and tells us the chicken takes 25 minutes to cook. How do you explain the extra 20 minutes that we've been waiting?! She then tells us we'll each get a free desert as a compensation. It's not that we couldn't afford to pay, but I would expect more professionalism from this type of restaurant. She then offers 25% off each person's bill. I was so hungry and didn't want to go through all the trouble of looking for another restaurant, so I accepted the offer. The bread and butter were cold; it felt like eating cardboard. Everyone's plate was bland. At that point, I just ate out of hunger. When it was time for the bill, the manager says only the birthday girl gets a free desert. We agreed on everyone getting a free desert plus 25% off on the bill. Each time we asked to speak to the manager, she would walk around avoiding our table or tell the waitress to come ask us how we are doing. During the whole night, we basically ate for 10 minutes because we were really hungry, and spent a total of 3 hours waiting for the manager and waitress to serve us. Manager is a liar and unprofessional. The waitress also lacks professionalism when speaking to customers; she was giving us attitude. Never once did the manager nor the waitress apologize.

No.\nI'm glad I tried it, but frankly, I think a big chunk of the price is paying for the nice decor.

I also had the old fashioned which was garnished with a slice of BACON ! I also tried their sangria because everyone in the restaurant was drinking it and I admit that I was intrigued. It wasn't my favorite of the three drinks but it was a very refreshing summer drink. Now for the food... the scallop carpaccio was good at first bite but then had a weird after taste that I didn't like. We then had the salmon tartar which was fresh but nothing special. I personally really enjoyed the lobster grilled cheese. Lobster is good...grilled cheese is good... so what's not to like! ;) My cousin wasn't too impressed because she said she could just make it at home but I really enjoyed it.

Everything was perfect from the service to the presentation to the taste of the food. I had the coq au vin chicken which came with the most perfectly diced, seasoned, and cooked carrots. My husband had the rabbit dish. Both were pure perfection. The menu said everything was traditional French cooking. Our waiter grew up in France. He told us about the small town in Northern France where he grew up. \n\nWe were in Montreal for our summer vacation and were staying at the hotel right next door. We walked by Chez La Mere Michel each day as we walked to the metro station. The menu was out in a box by the street and we perused it.  I had wanted to try and find a traditional French restaurant while we were in Montreal and it turned out we did not have to look far! We looked it up and found it had been named one of the top restaurants in Montreal by the New York Times so we figured that was a good sign and decided to try it for dinner.\n\nBefore we ordered our food, we had fresh bread with butter. The waiter also informed us if we wanted to have the chocolate souffle, we would need to order it then as it would require about an hour for preparation. We decided on different desserts. I can't remember the exact names of our desserts, but my husband had the frozen chocolate mousse. I had the poached pear which sat atop sherbet which was placed in a crispy almond bowl. I believe the sherbet was raspberry. This was the best dessert I've ever eaten. If I get back to Montreal, I will go there simply for this dessert! If you want a nice dinner that makes you feel like you have been transported to France, then give Chez La Mere Michel a go. You will not regret it.

Outside, it was sleeting.  Inside, we were immediately greeted by Marc, who welcomed us into the warmth as if we were family.  In true French style, the staff wore tuxedoes, but made us feel right at home.  We were seated, and immediately brought fresh-baked bread and warmed butter, as well as great recommendations for wine pairings.  I ended up deliberating over all the delicious entrees, but settled on the 20th Anniversary Celebration menu (good timing for a visit!), which was a crab bisque appetizer, duck medallions a l'orange entree, and a raspberry souffle dessert.  I picked the unconventional appetizer (given the entree), so Marc recommended and brought a glass of chardonnay well-paired with the appetizer and also segue-ing nicely into the entree, which was accompanied by a wonderful bordeaux the lady and I shared.  My girlfriend had similar menu, with a strawberry pastry with cream dessert which, although I can't remember the name, was absolutely amazing.

The flavors and presentation was exquisite.\n\nWe split the duck entree -- Cuisse de canard confite, r\u00f6stis de panais, petite salade de roquette et gastrique aux framboises (Confit duck leg, parsnip r\u00f6sti, aragula salad and rasberry gastric).   This was exceptionally prepared and melted in our mouths.\n\nBut food alone doesn't make a five star restaurant.  On top of good food the servers were attentive and made us feel at home.\n\nShould I say we had flamb\u00e9 Crepe Suzettes?   The servers prepare them in the middle of the restaurant which makes a nice show for all.\n\nIf you are looking for a special Montreal restaurant, we recommend Beaver Hall.\n\nSee their website: http://www.beaverhall.ca/."]}}, "IcFunpqxHyl0PyYZLrCAXg": {"reviews": {"3": ["Nominated for people's choice award in Air Canada Enroute magazine, we could not pass on the opportunity to dine here during our recent weekend visit to Montreal. This intent almost came to nought on Sat night when we could not find reservations for dinner. I called up the restaurant and spoke to the reservationist to check if there were any tables or cancelations for the evening. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they could make arrangements for our party. I was then kept on hold for a while only to later be informed that they cannot accommodate us. I was bummed with the service since it was getting pretty late in the night and we almost started driving towards the restaurant. Anyways, upon checking opentable for sunday reservations there was no problem getting a table at our desired time. The restaurant is on a quiet street and was not too busy when we arrived. The service was as expected given that only a few tables were occupied. I was disappointed to learn that they don't have any pisco sours or a cocktail menu but they offered a full service bar and limited wine menu. We mostly stuck to the small plates and ordered a bunch. The amuse bouche was mind blowing (it was a duck heart dipped in huancaina sauce). This only set the bar higher for what was to follow. Unfortunately there were a few misses with the rest of the dinner. \n\nOctopus was too sweet since it was glazed with maple. The first few bites were interesting but the sweetness was overpowering with every subsequent bite\n\nThe crispy shrimp was creative but overrated. The sauce again erred on the side of sweetness but you cannot eat w/o it since it's dry. I quite enjoyed the thinly shaved phyllo crust on the shrimp though - very light although it was deep fried\n\nTiradito of Red deer with foie gras did not pack the flavor punch we were expecting. It was a good dish but not a great one.\n\nThe lucuma dessert was probably one of the biggest disappointments. For those who've never had lucuma will most likely like it but for those who've tried it before you will definitely notice the difference. The ice cream itself was not sweet but the dulce de leche added the sweet component to the dish. I liked the fact that they added some cocoa nibs to balance the overall sweetness in the dessert.\n\nOur favorite was the asian style crispy duck arepitas with foie gras torchon. It was juicy and the fresh chinese buns were the perfect fluffy pillow to absorb the jus. We craved for more and ended up ordering it again.\n\nThere was definitely creativity on display but none of the dishes except the crispy duck would make me order it again.", "ditched au pied du cochon and came here because of the review.\nthe service is the best. when i made the reservation, i requested a table at the corner /with a nice view by the window because my sister was visiting and they confirmed so  before the visit. it's really nice of them. and throughout the dinner they were very attentive so that our glasses (of water) were always full.\n\nunfortunately the menu isn't really attractive to us. i would settle for less service and go for the duck in a can and sea urchin pasta next time when i visit montreal.\n\nthe amuse which is a piece of duck. i think it's the best for the whole meal.\nwe ordered two appetizers and one main, one dessert.\nthe clam in a pot - too salty and the fries on the side too thin\nthe lime juice scallop/salmon - sauce so overpowering i couldnt tell which one is which\nmain was some beef flank with corn souffl\u00e9 in a korean style of rock hot pot. i actually like it. it's quite special.\nthe dessert - chocolate souffl\u00e9. it's not airy at all. it's a molten cake.\n\nthe tasting menu seems to be quite attractive for its price but my sister would like a second dinner at la banquise for some poutine instead....\n\nfor as much as i would like to give it more stars because of the friendly and attentive services, the food did not impress my taste bud....", "I'd been wanting to try Mezcla for sometime now, actually since I'd read Lesley Chesterman's 2013 article in the Gazette on \"Best New Restaurants\" in Montreal. I'd twice tried to get a last minute reservation to no avail, so with a weeks planning I was looking forward to trying this joint, known for Latin American flavored tapas with a twist.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant about fifteen minutes early for our 7 o'clock reservation - I was jetlagged and starving. It was mostly empty with only 2-3 active tables. Then the hostess (who spoke absolutely no english, which shocked both myself and my francophone date - we later made an educated guess that she was dating who appeared to be a manager/owner as she left with him very early), attempted to seat us at a shared table with other guests who were already dining. This is where my first objection took place - An almost empty restaurant and you try to sit us at a shared table? Annoying for us and the already doing couple. She gave us an annoyed look and but still proceeded to seat is at our own table. After this incident, the service excelled, in both official languages, with well-trained and professional wait staff (well, until the very end, but we'll get to that).\n\nMezcla has a great wine list, very diverse and affordable - we selected a great Portuguese white, a blend of three different grapes and it was midrange at only $46. \n\nThe menu is very appealing, particularly in the seafood and fish department, which prior to dinning there, I'd assumed would be their fort\u00e9. They offer a 5 of 7 course chefs tasting menu for $40-$70 alternately, a great deal, and we'd originally planned to get this. However we were disappointed to read the fine print on the menu and find guests are unable to specify allergies or preferences and as such should order a-la-carte - not really geared towards folks with allergies, perhaps kosher/halal, pescetarians or the ever-growing gluten-intolerant among us!\n\nWe choose instead to get three starters and a main to share. Deciding on the octopus, molecular, and shrimp starters and the pork chicharron's main. Even though we specified we'd be sharing everything, the octopus and molecular starters arrived simultaneously, and they had to hold off bringing the shrimp as we were still finishing our second plate. The octopus was good, well cooked and a nice texture added when you got lucky and had a crunchy piece of corn alongside a bite - but there was too much of the heavy sauce in our opinion. Next the molecular seafood starter, which combined again octopus, salmon, tuna and a whitefish in a ceveiche-like marinade - this was delicious, and definitely our favored starting dish; the marinade/sauce was spicy and fresh and those delicious corn kernels again. Finally the shrimp came, it was really a huge prawn circle-wrapped in layers of ribbon-like batter. This was tasty as well, though we both found the brown sauce too sweet, but the alternate green corn source flavorful - our complaint here was with the presentation and serving of this dish on a cutting board. It's an extremely messy dish, and I love messy food, but the cutting board isn't suited for a dish as such, with bits n' pieces flying everywhere (I've included a picture of some of the remains). Instead I think a dish with some kind of edge, to be used as a border against the flying debris, would be better. \n\nThe pork chicharron's main ended up being the highlight of the meal - but we're lucky we shared, as this would've been far too much for a single diner. Delicious and melt-in-your-mouth pork covered in a tasty sweet & tangy sauce and topped with crunchy julienned apple slaw. \n\nFinally, the service slipped again when we had to wait about fifteen minutes after requesting our bill. They also don't take Amex, which in my opinion is fine for a low cost restaurant but not really for places located in major cities with allusions to fine dining. \n\nAll-in-all, Mezcla is a thoroughly \"OK\" joint."], "4": ["As a first note, the food here deserves five stars. I'd give such a review save for one thing. Our table was seated near the half-open kitchen and I overheard one of the cooks/chefs saying something incredibly inappropriate to a server while bitching her out. So if you're sitting near the kitchen, beware of whoever this foul-mouthed dude is. That said, everything at the table (from the sticky bun entrees to the magret with the bison ribs in between) was absolutely glorious. The wine list is affordable and the service is generally wonderful, save for some water filling-related hovering. That said, the open kitchen is slightly annoying, writ-large, as the chef has to leave the kitchen to finish some of the dishes, and they don't really have their expediting system down. Endame, you must try the pouding chomeur!", "We really enjoyed the food, as expected, so I will base my rating of 4 stars on the  food experience. If you're looking for inspiring cuisine, you simply can't go wrong here.\n\nHowever, my night was marred by the tall dark bearded waiter who was clearly trying to maximize our bill. He first told us emphatically that it's \"impossible\" to share any dishes as they are not conducive for sharing - we soon discovered that all dishes could be easily shared.  Then, after recommending a more reasonably priced wine, he presents a more expensive alternative (I vividly recall seeing it at the bottom of the list), explaining this bottle would be more appropriate for the dishes we ordered.  \n\nWe left having really enjoyed our meal, but with this unfortunate taste in my mouth of being had. shame, really. Please don't let the above comments discourage you from visiting - just be on the lookout for that guy and hope his colleagues don't employ the same tactics.", "Loved the vibe and had wonderful (as long as you don't mind familiar) service. The amuse and apps were definitely the highlight of this meal, far outshining the main courses.\n\nThe amuse was a perfectly cooked bite of duck, really a great start. For apps, we shared the venison with foie (really good), the smoked duck (fantastic, non-kitschy smoke-releasing presentation and a flavor heavy on anise, which I as a licorice hater somehow found room to adore), and a raw fish and yucca plate (not totally memorable, but definitely fresh and not disappointing). I think we were all hoping for killer next courses, but I think we all were a little nonplussed. Two of us went for the seafood mix, which had its highs and lows (not too rich broth strangely labeled as a bisque with some great bits of fish and some lackluster mussels), and another for the pork (definitely not the best iteration any of us had tried). Still, I think the tone of the meal and the good start made this an overall positive and I'd go back to find some better dishes to try. \n\nIt is a relatively pricey meal, and the wine list reflects that."], "5": ["Mezcla is, without a doubt, the best restaurant in Montreal's Gay Village and one of the very best new restaurants in the whole city. The decor was rather bland, but the wooden bar and open kitchen in the back did give the place a nice warmth. The food was, in a word, excellent. An innovative mix of modern latino cuisine and local Quebec ingredients. Very reasonable prices, including wines. Don't let the sometimes classic dish names fool you, every single thing we tasted was a surprising mix, fresh and unexpected. The ceviche, blood sausage and \u00abpudding chomeur\u00bb were by far the best versions of these dishes I've ever tasted. The 39$, 5-course tasting meal is the best deal in the city, hands down. Seriously, go right now before they raise their prices, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThey've been getting rave reviews and are now super busy, a reservation is definitely recommended.", "I am a New Yorker and everytime I go to Montreal I hit up Mezcla atleast twice during my stay... I am a vegetarian and they always surprise me with something insanely delicious that is made specially for me. They have a wonderful staff that is extremely professional.

We started with calamari, which were tasty, and mussels in a marinara sauce that was amazing. My brother ordered a pasta dish with sausage, I think, in a \"rose\" sauce. The sauce was tasty and the pasta was perfectly al dente--the whole table remarked on it. The pizza was nice and salty, with a good neapolitan style crust.

It's small, with only about 5 x 2-person tables inside plus 10-15 single bar chairs around - perfect if you feel like rocking in solo. \n\nThe burger and poutine menus offer a nice, classic variety. My choice was their \"Mont-Royal\" burger which is a beef burger with smoked bacon, caramelized onions, barbecue sauce, Boston lettuce and tomato. It was pure goodness, which I think owed a lot to the sweet burger buns that held everything together. The fries and the caesar salad were excellent as well, and of generous proportions. My husband and I shared the fries and the salad that came with my burger (he ordered only the burger), and it was more than enough. The alcoholic drinks menu is interesting too, though the cocktails at $12 a pop were beyond my dinner budget, so I didn't order any. \n\nHaving said all those good things, my biggest compliments actually go to either the service or the music. It's a very tight race. We were served by one of the nicest, most competent servers I have ever encountered in a burger place. Aside from being very friendly, he topped up our glasses of water as often as needed (the glass was tiny) without us having to ask.  As for the music, when I was there that evening, they were playing an international remix of 80's dance/pop; there was never a dull moment, at least for me! It was so good I asked the server if they were playing their homemade CD because if it was, I would love to buy it. Sadly no, he said that it was from a satellite radio. \n\nHands-down, best burger place in the Plateau Mont-Royal. Next time I will try their poutine!", "Really pleased. The poutine was super tasty (and huge), the hot dogs were amazing (and huge) and the Mason drinks were to die for (and huge). Everything is so inexpensive compared to some other places. Not to mention the staff ... They were just as wonderful and pleasant. You gotta try the place of you haven't already.", "I had a great experience dining at Mange Moi one warm Friday lunch hour in August and will definitely be back.  It was one of those experiences that was just great, and we left knowing we'll be back sometime.\n\nThe place is small. Think a slightly larger and more upscale/trendy Patati-Patata.  There's an L shaped bar, a few tables, and a few window counters.  There's a fully stocked bar (I'll have to return to sample a mason jar cocktail sometime), and a good selection of beers on tap (a combination of local and import).  The music was top 40, which normally I don't particularly care for, but somehow it worked.\n\nThe service is friendly.  It took awhile for us to get our orders, but I chalk it up to the place being so busy at lunch time.  It didn't really matter, we were happy to just hang out and drink our beers.\n\nThe food!  These were some awesome burgers.  We each had a burger, but no sides, and this was perfect for a nice lunch.  We left feeling satisfied, but not disgustingly full.  I had the lamb burger, and it was overly \"lamb-y\", and had a greek vibe going on.\n\nSo overall, none of the individual components scream \"AWESOME!\", but it all just worked so well together, and was exactly what we felt like at that moment.\n\nThis would make a great place to stop in for post work drinks and munchies."]}}, "clXWPRAlZ9DFYHcEdI-ukg": {"reviews": {"1": ["Wo made a reservation for 12 at this place,  on a Monday night,  to celebrate the departure of a friend moving to Europe.

Modavie left an impression of a one trick pony, able to technically cook a proper meal yet lacking any creativity to make it a culinary destination worthy of returning patronage. A real disappointment considering the quality of restaurants like Garde Manger just around the corner.\n\n\nOur Experience::\n\nWe made New Years Eve reservations after reading the positive reviews online of the restaurant. When we mentioned we had reservations upon arrival, the front of house manager looked at us and gruffly asked, \"You know it's a $95/plate meal tonight right?\" \n\nBoth dressed well, (me in a dress and designer boots and my partner in a suit,) I'm not sure if he asked this because we looked younger (we're in our mid twenties) or because we are a same sex couple. \n\nOur waitress was polite and seemed like a nice person but showed little to no knowledge of the menu. When we asked what she would recommend off the prix-fixe menu she said, \"Umm one of the first two?\" She also questioned me when I ordered a cocktail off the menu because she admired she didn't know the restaurant made the drink.\n\nBeing more cocktail drinkers than wine drinkers, we were disappointed with the lack of quality and selection of cocktails. The bar couldn't even make a standard \"old fashioned\" because they lacked the ingredients.\n\nBeing New Years the chef was serving a prix-fixe menu.\n\nThe starter was a large prawn with a salad finished with caviar. The prawn was tasty and well prepared, however the salad consisted of leaves and globs of dressing that wasn't even tossed to coat the leaves and some caviar tossed carelessly on top. The flavor of the salad was lackluster and showed a real apathy on part of the kitchen in my opinion.\n\nDuring our starter the front of house manager came to greet all the tables except for ours, yet another indication of rudeness. \n\nOur mains were technically well prepared in that the sear on the beef was a perfect medium rare and the fish was juicy and flaky. The accompanying vegetables were also soundly technically prepared however lacked any imagination. The most interesting part of the dish was a beet root mash. Otherwise, the filet mignon had a rather boring flavorless sauce, and was presented with salted roasted potatoes and steamed bok choy with two asparagus springs. My partners fish had much of the same except for rice rather than potatoes.\n\nEach dish tasted good but would never stand out as interesting, creative and exceptionally prepared. Instead I had the impression that this is a restaurant that seems to have fallen asleep and is riding off the ability to cook consistently to clientelle that isn't looking to be wowed and intrigued by their meals.\n\nOur desert was possibly the best part of our meal. The chocolate mousse was beautifully flavored, not too sweet with a deep chocolate flavor that was never bitter. The only complaint was that the accompanying orange sorbet did little to elevate and add to the dish. \n\nConsidering the bill came to over $300 we left feeling our money could have been better spent at another restaurant more engaged in providing a stand out experience. \n\nConclusion:: this is a good place to take a boring aunt interested in stuck up service and run of the mill dishes but for a true dining experience that will leave you impressed skip Modavie and head to Garde Manger down the street.", "We went with high expectations and were sorely disappointed\nFor me , a culinary infraction in a highly touted restaurant can be overlooked if at least the service is acceptable which was not the case here\nTo think that they would mess up a simple dish like steamed mussels and frites is remarkable\nIt was poorly prepared , dry , and cold cos the waiter forgot about it\nThe last straw was that the waiter never once asked how the meal was, quietly came around with his card swiping machine , picked up the tip and went off and we like idiots actually tipped for this abismal meal\n\nAvoid this place there are a ton of amazing restaurants in Montreal"], "2": ["Very mediocre food.

We arrived 30 minutes early before our reservation at 1830 - most tables had reserved signs but since we got in before the big rush we had first choice (and sat right next to where the jazz duo would later perform). They were the highlight of the night.\n\nAs a young couple in our mid-20's we received the service we normally get - sub-par. We needed afew extra minutes to order as my girlfriend went to the washroom soon after arriving. Afew extra minutes turned into about 10 minutes.

The waiter dropped off the Tiramisu's and then promptly disappeared. No coffee or espresso offered. He returned when we both finished and asked how it was: I told him flat out that I would have enjoyed a coffee with the dessert but he neglected to ask. He had offered then but I refused as the moment had passed.\n\nIt was after that when we waited far too long to pay for the meal. I've learned through the years that paying more doesn't necessarily yield a better meal. This is definitely the case with Modavie as a young couple. The live music was brilliant, food was mediocre (as compared to Lola Rosa where we can eat for a fraction of the price) and the service was disrespectful.\n\nWe filled out a commentary card which the waiter glanced at when we left the table though I doubt this will break the view waiters have of Gen-Y.

The escargot, an easy texture lacking the chewy quality you often get with the dish, sat atop a puff pastry in a light cream sauce.

She got the \"Mesclun salad with goat cheese on croutons topped with apple cider dressing\" and I got the \"Endive and apple salad with Roquefort and a walnut oil vinaigrette\", both were amazing.  Let me say real quick that this restaurant offers something that most if not all restaurants don't offer these days and especially in a tourist area (HALF PORTIONS).  I love that fact since you don't want to over eat and when you can't talk the leftovers home it is a waste to get too much food.  Okay, back to the food.  For our dinner my wife ordered the \"Halibut with an avocado and lime salsa\" and I ordered the \"Ravioli stuffed with goat cheese in a roasted pepper and spinach sauce\".  Both were very good and I have nothing really bad to say about our experience at Modavie.\n\nThe only regret I have is on me, since I didn't get wine at a wine bar.

I normally would not have blue cheese, but it was blended perfectly with the endives and pear and greens in the plate. The flavor filled my nose as the wine flew through my throat. \n\nThe live jazz was my favorite. The vocal, guitar, and cello humbly played in the background. Never too loud or noisy.

The ONLY bright spot of the experience was that their greeter successfully managed to greet us without insult.", "One of the most regrettable dining experiences. As soon as we were seated I could sense something was off. Soon enough I got a taste of the conniving and insulting modi operandi used by the wait staff. Our waiter was completely aloof and acted like he was on crack. he never checked up on us and when he did 'interact\" with us, he had the most suspicious look on his face. The only thing that drew me to this tourist trap was the \"lobster bisque\" displayed on the outside menu. After confirmation from the waiter that the bisque was \"truly amazing\", I ordered it. When it arrived, I noticed there was absolutely NO lobster in it and it was super thin. I asked the waiter about this and he said the lobster is pureed. Really? You take something with such immaculate texture like lobster and pulverize it? If that really were the case it would not have been so thin. Anyway, I gave it a try and I can honestly say it was the most disgusting soup. Tasted like 80% water, 10% lobster broth and 10% metal from a can. And at $10, this attempt at bisque was just comical. After my one taste and my bf's confirmatory taste, I asked the waiter to take it back.  25 min later, my bf received his steak and fries. The steak was definitely over-sauced to mask its sub-par quality. When the bill arrived, I see that the lobster was not removed. When I inquired, the ignorant waiter said it could not be removed, but don't worry \"it can be in place of [his] tip\". Haha, did he think we were planning on giving him a $10+ tip? I asked to speak to the manager and he hesitantly went to get him. Some other employee then told me there was no problem with taking the \"bisque\" off the bill. \nOur waiter was the bald late 20/early 30 year old guy. Note to the owner: you should fire him and work on your menu.\nI truly hope people see this review and do not waste their money here.", "horrible. tourist trap. the waiter smell like he had never bathed in his whole life. worst onion soup ever."], "2": ["Food portions were underwhelming for the price.

All of the adult entrees were delicious.", "We went to Maree last evening after spending the day in Vieux Monteal. We wandered around the square, know that all the restaurants were geared towards tourists. Our expectations weren't too high, but we wanted a place that had a decent selection for adults, and options for our kids.\n\nMy wife had the duck confit, and she thought it was well prepared. She tries it whenever possible, so she knows how she likes it. I had the moules, since I wasn't very hungry and didn't want a heavy meal. The children had pasta (of course). \n\nThe service was good; the waiter was around enough to grab him if needed, and he checked in often enough. I hate hovering waiters, so if you prefer to have someone check in after every bite, this may not be enough for you.\n\nThe food received thumbs up from everyone. I was a little concerned given how touristy the area looked, but I was pleasantly surprised. My mussels weren't overcooked, and my wife enjoyed the duck, The kids were satisfied, which pretty much means the pasta didn't' have \"extra stuff on it\".\n\nThe beer selection was meager, but my wife was able to get a Riesling by the glass, which made her happy.\n\nThe kids received desserts with their meals, and paid the \"parent tax\". The desserts were nothing special, but we still finished them.\n\nThe one thing which bothered me (even recognizing we were eating outside) were the number of flies around. The tables were clean, so there wasn't an obvious source.

Such a graceful dish.\n\nFor maincourse, I had the lamb shanks which was so perfect at first but slowly lost its charm by the end of the meal. The meat was tender,almost falling off its bone and was paired with a side of spinach( i think), chickpeas and cream cheese. I loved that pairing and the gravy also had a bit of tomato. It was great! But i don't know why it didn't feel the best at the end, could be because the dish wasn't as hot and I don't like eating cold-ish lamb.\n\nMy sister took gnocchi and it tasted amazing. However, we also tried the cod pasta which wasn't all that great.\n\nI feel part of why my experience wasn't as fantastic was because the waiter was not too welcoming. He was friendly, yeah, but he seemed reluctant to explain things on the menu. The entire menu was in italian and we were barely understanding what to order. But he gave me an impression that I 'should' be able to understand it. But he had great wine recommendation!", "I was really expecting to love this place, having heard and read great things...maybe it was the \"hype\", but I was disappointed. It was good but nothing spectacular or better than average. \n\nWe were able to get last minute reservations at the bar for 2...and I have to say that we were seated right away and that the bar seating is well made so it didn't feel awkward or like you were in the way.  \nBUT no one offered to take our coats --  they offered for some patrons but not others -- and they silently dumped menus in front of us and left us to our own devices for a few good long minutes until we awkwardly caught someone's eye. \nThe wine menu was good with a lot of good, reasonably priced options. \nWe ordered the charcuterie plate as an entree - it was small for 30$/2 and nothing spectacular. The mortadella was delicious but the other cold cuts and terrines were just ok and the olives were scalding hot for some reason.\nWe followed up with bucatini cascio e pepe and the porchetta plate. The pasta was al Dente and good, but again, nothing great. The porchetta plate was a big, generous portion served with a side of rapini. The porchetta was tasty and good, with a good mix of fat and crust...but dry. The rapini were very good. \nWe had the little ricotta donuts with grapefruit for dessert - delicious but small portion. \nThroughout, the service was minimal. No friendly smiles or chit chat ...", "I decided to go here on my birthday and was really disappointed as was the entire group. I'm shocked it has so many great reviews. We ordered a variety of plates based on the Chesterman review and on the waiter's recommendation but nothing really blew me away. The service was good and the wine was nice, but I was definitely expecting more complexity from the dishes especially considering the high price point."], "4": ["We were there this saturday and really enjoyed our evening there. Our server was awesome ; kind, profesionnal, knew his wines. Very very good service which is already enough to have me say we'll be back. \n\nThe appetizers were very good. There was a special dish inspired by the market, therefore we enjoyed a great veal carpaccio (YUM!) and a classic yet flawless burrata mozzarella appetizer (double YUM!)\n\nI was expecting to be really impressed by the pasta. Homemade, and all of them were shapes that we don't eat too often, so that was fun ! Surprisingly though, it was good yet not as much as I had hoped so. My boyfriend had the full plate of the pasta of the day and felt like it was a small portion. I had tons of seafood in mine which made up for the sauce which I felt was a little underwhelming. However, don't get me wrong, it was still really tasty. You can tell how fresh their food is. Really.\n\nThe cheese plate was a bit of a bummer. We didn't get how and why a cheese platter could include a huge portion of parmesan. BUT the caciocavallo and the gorgonzala themselves were more than enough. The servings were huge and the price really reasonable !\n\nDesert was PER-FECT. And so was the wine !!\n\nIt's a place to try. Nice ambiance, awesome service and very cute decor. \nAround 50$ per person, before wine + tips. \n\nYou should go !", "Location: Little Italy - on Dante, right off of St. Laurent. Street parking only - look out for the resident-only parking zones!\n\nThe place: Loved the simple but modern decor, with its large windows that offer up perfect lighting. What can I say, you notice light when you're into photography! The restaurant isn't huge by any means, but they do make good use of the floor space. That said, you'll need reservations if you want a table, and you'll want to book well in advance. I was unsuccessful in getting reservations when I tried to book 1-2 weeks ahead of time (twice) so.... you've been warned. \n\nThe food: OK - I think my expectations were set excessively high due to the reviews, and as such, I felt a little disappointed. Don't panic - this isn't a crappy review. My date and I started with the buratta and tomato, which was both fresh and delicious. It's not very heavy either, so is the perfect starter because it won't fill you up before you receive your main. We decided to share the appetizer and from my perspective, it was perfect for two people. Now, if you're a 200-pound male, you might want to get your own appetizer. \n\nMy main was pasta with lobster. Do I remember the name of the pasta? Nope, but it's very similar to Strozzapreti, which is a short, thick noodle that has a bit of a twist. The pasta was al dente and perfectly cooked. Personally, I felt that there was enough lobster in my plate, BUT others may not feel the same for the price point. The lobster was fresh but I found it to be somewhat chewy. In terms of overall flavor, it pains me to say that the dish was underwhelming. I was expecting the dish to burst with flavor but sadly, it did not. Flavor was almost non-existent. My date on the other hand, really enjoyed the Casarecce so maybe I just ordered the wrong dish or the chef was having an off-night. \n\nI ended with the Tiramisu, which was delicious. Perfect balance of coffee and cream - I would have bought several jars of these to bring home, had they been for sale =-D\n\nService: Great. Our waiter was friendly, took the time to explain the menu, made suggestions on what to eat and drink, and patiently waited while we decided on what to order. \n\nPrice point: A little painful. Considering the size of the portions (small), and also taking into consideration the quality of the food (great), I feel that the menu is a little overpriced. For a glass of wine, appetizer, main and dessert, it cost me $73 (excluding tip). At this price point, I would perhaps expect complimentary Prosecco or something.\n\nVerdict: I enjoyed my overall experience so I'll give these guys a redo.", "Je suis all\u00e9e dans ce petit restaurant au coeur de la Petite-Italie pour une soir\u00e9e en amoureux avec mon copain. N'y \u00e9tant jamais all\u00e9e, je ne savais pas trop \u00e0 quoi m'attendre. Nous avions r\u00e9serv\u00e9 une table \u00e0 21h. Le resto \u00e9tait plein, l'ambiance \u00e9tait effervescente, mais pas trop bruyante non plus. Le d\u00e9cor \u00e9tait super : de grandes fen\u00eatres, une cuisine ouverte sur la salle \u00e0 manger, un espace comptoir qui avait l'air vraiment invitant (je l'essayerais volontiers lors d'une prochaine visite). \n\nLe menu \u00e9tait simple : 4 \u00e0 5 choix d'antipasti, 4 choix de p\u00e2tes, 4 choix de viandes. La serveuse a pris le temps de bien nous expliquer les diff\u00e9rents plats, qui avaient tous l'air aussi all\u00e9chants les uns que les autres. On a d'abord partag\u00e9 l'entr\u00e9e de tartare de boeuf. Personnellement, je suis une \"fan finie\" des tartares et celui-ci \u00e9tait vraiment diff\u00e9rent de tous ceux que j'ai pu go\u00fbter dans le pass\u00e9. J'ai l'habitude des tartares de boeuf classiques vinaigr\u00e9s, mais celui d'Impasto, avec sa mayonnaise \u00e0 la moelle, \u00e9tait tout simplement d\u00e9licieux : on go\u00fbtait bien le boeuf et la saveur d\u00e9licate de la moelle. Un dosage parfait, bien \u00e9quilibr\u00e9.\n\nMon copain a ensuite opt\u00e9 pour le confit de canard, servi avec des prunes grill\u00e9es et une polenta cr\u00e9meuse. Pour ma part, j'ai pris la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 de la maison : la porchetta del nonno. Servie avec un poire poch\u00e9e \u00e0 la vanille et des rapinis saut\u00e9s, c'\u00e9tait tout simplement sublime. J'irais m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 dire que c'est la meilleure viande que j'aie go\u00fbt\u00e9e de toute ma vie. \u00c7a fondait litt\u00e9ralement dans la bouche. La peau \u00e9tait croustillante, la viande \u00e9tait tendre et juteuse, la farce \u00e9tait savoureuse. Magnifique. Et la poire ajoutait une douceur et une fra\u00eecheur subtiles au plat.\n\nOn a finalement partag\u00e9 un lemone au dessert : une meringue italienne napp\u00e9e de cr\u00e8me au citron. Une belle touche de fra\u00eecheur pour terminer ce copieux repas.\n\nEn somme, j'ai ador\u00e9 l'endroit. Tout au long de la soir\u00e9e, on a eu droit \u00e0 un service attentionn\u00e9, discret et rapide. L'ambiance \u00e9tait vraiment cool et le repas \u00e9tait authentique et savoureux. Pr\u00e9voir toutefois un bon 50$ par personne + vin + pourboire pour la soir\u00e9e. En somme, Impasto est un resto que je garderai d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment en t\u00eate pour les occasions sp\u00e9ciales."], "5": ["Went to Impasto on a late Wednesday evening (our reservation was for 8:30pm) and the place was absolutely packed. Crazy busy so make sure you reserve in advance.  We sat at the bar and had great seats of the chefs working their magic. Our server was fantastic - explained the menu thoroughly and made a few suggestions on what to order. \n\nWe decided to share a couple of dishes between the two of us:\n- Homemade Apuglia style sausage ($13) - came with rapini in an apple vinegar. Sausage was tender and full of flavour. Rapini gave a nice contrast to the sausage.\n- Mafalde pasta ($20 for full size) with rabbit ragu, chicory and olives. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dante.  This is deliciousness on a plate.\n- Nonno's porchetta roast ($26) - a massive portion of perfectly cooked porchetta. Just the right amount of fattiness to it. Nice crispiness on the outside and super tender on the inside (you could break it with your fork!). Came with rapini and poached pears.\n- Tiramisu ($7) - small portion but you can taste the cream/liquor in the tiramisu. Perfect way to end our meal.\n- Glass of pinot grigio ($10)\n\nEverything was amazing - full of flavour and cooked perfectly. Wish we had ordered more so I could have tasted more of the menu. If I lived in Montreal still, I would be back! Especially for their lunch menu which I believe is very reasonable (2 for $19, 3 for $25).\n\nGreat spot in Little Italy. Go go go.", "After a few months of waiting, I finally had the chance to check out the Italian restaurant everyone is talking about right now - Impasto. This small space, located in the heart of Little Italy and only a short walk from the Jean Talon Market, was born of the collaboration between Michele Forgione (formerly of Osteria Venti) and Stefano Faita, host of CBC's In the Kitchen. Impasto aims to provide great Italian food with no shortcuts - almost everything is made in house. Walking into the space, that level of craft permeates even the decor. Beautiful open kitchen with wood panel walls, leather banquettes, terrazzo floors, Pelligrino bottles lining the ceiling and just enough lighting to really brighten up the room. I sat down with a Negrini in hand, ready to enjoy a wonderful meal with a group of friends.\n\nFirst up, we have the Insalada di Moscardini - baby octopus, fennel, potato and red onion salad. A beautifully balanced salad. The freshness of the fennel combined nicely with the bite of the red onion, the starch of the potatoes and the fatty octopus. Add a little olive oil and some herbs and you had a great starter to the meal.\n\nThe other starter I got to try was the housemade Apulia style sausage with pan seared rapini and apple vinegar. Great texture to the sausage as well as great flavour. The combination of the rapini and the apple vinegar adds some nice acidity to the fatty sausage. I know rapini isn't everyone's thing but I personally love it so that worked for me.\n\nThe next course was the pasta course. I went for the ricotta gnocchi with basil infused tomato sauce. This dish is probably Chef Forgione's speciality and I had heard so much about it that I wasn't sure it could meet my expectations. Well..... it blew them out of the water. The slow pillowy texture of each morsel. The rich ricotta flavour. I have never had gnocchi that literally melt in your mouth like these ones did. Lightly tossed with a simple but very flavourful tomato sauce, this was pretty much the best pasta dish I have had all year almost without saying. Bravo Chef! \n\nI also got to try another pasta dish - the mafalde with rabbit ragu, chicory and olives. The mafalde pasta itself was wonderful - great texture, indicative of people who know how to make great in-house pasta. The combination of the rabbit ragu with the chicory made for very earthy notes - a nice contrast to the richness of the ricotta gnocchi I had previously.\n\nFor the next course, I went with Nonno's porchetta roast served with a vanilla pear, pan seared rapini and some candied fruits. This was an amazing roast - deliciously rich and fatty pork meat with crispy skin. The skin wasn't the crispest I've ever had but still wonderful. The inclusion of the vanilla pear and the candied fruits provided some sweetness to balance with the inherent saltiness and fattiness of the roast itself. I love porchetta and Impasto's take just reinforced my love.\n\nFor dessert, we went with the Tiramisu and the chocolate tort cake. I'm not a big fan of Tiramisu due to my hatred of coffee but this one was milder in terms of the coffee taste and had a wonderfully smooth texture. The chocolate cake had more of a brownie texture - very dense but still moist. Very well executed.\n\nThis was a great meal all around. Impasto aims for great Italian food and they hit on all the notes. As a party, we did find the service to be slightly slow in terms of bringing water and taking wine orders but it is a minor quibble. Now, the menu changes seasonly and ironically enough, they just changed the menu for the fall so you won't be able to try the dishes I described above. However, that should not stop you from going menu unseen. I have no doubts you will be as satisfied as I was. Now, I just want to go back to see what Chef Forgione and company have in mind for the current season.\n\nCheers!", "I recently was in Little Italy and went to Impasto. Wow - absolutely outstanding!\nIt is hard to describe the food, a few words that come to mind are: incredible, delicious, addictive, fun, art!   \n\nArt - not in the looks (it looks ok), but in the taste, full of various delicious flavours in your mouth....\n\nService was excellent with an efficient and friendly waiter - well done !!!"]}}, "1RLGEWT2iU_wYUr6L6QQzg": {"reviews": {"1": ["First of all, there are two restaurants named Reuben's on Sainte-Catherine. This one is across the street from Place Montreal Trust and you have to descend a flight of stairs to get to the dining area. The dinning room is dark, the booths are cramped and narrow. The waitstaff are inhospitable although from what I could tell, if you speak french (I do not) the service suddenly gets better. After establishing that we did not speak french with our waitress, she continued to only speak to us in french even though we heard her speaking english to other employees. \n\nThe food was below average and pricey for what it was.", "I wish I could write a full review of Reuben's, unfortunately I can't comment on the food as I was never seated. I can, however, comment on the service. \n\nMy wife was off eating with friends, and I was on my own for dinner. Since Reuben's was close to my hotel and well-reviewed, that was where I'd planned on eating.\n\nAfter arriving, I informed the hostess that I wanted a table for one, and that I would be happy to sit at the bar since they were busy. She took my name, told me it would be 20 minutes, and directed me to the waiting area. I waited. After she began seating people who came in after me at the bar, I asked why I'd been passed over. She looked at her sheet and said I had accidentally been overlooked. She told me they would have me seated within 15 minutes. \n\nWhat?! I asked her if she was serious and she nodded dismissively.\n\nHaving no backup plan for dinner, I decided to wait it out. 20 minutes later, it happened again. A group that came in after me was seated. I asked if I'd been skipped again and her response was, \"It appears so.\"\n\nAfter standing there for over 40 minutes, I walked out. I'm still not sure why it happened, but all I got out of Reuben's was a terrible customer service experience.", "I was so disappointed with this restaurant. I am not sure why it got so many good reviews from other reviewers.\n\nFirst off, if a restaurant has about 200 different items to chose from on their menu, you already know food is not going to be of good quality. \nI decided to go for the smoke meat sandwich, as it is \"their specialty\". The meat was poorly seasoned, over salted, and whey over cooked.\n\nThe service was the worse I have experienced in a long time. The staff working that day all looked like they wanted to shoot themselves, and our waiter was really unpleasant, taping his pencil on his pad when we were making decisions about what to take...and it's not like he was in a rush, cause the place was basically empty...\n\nThe food was way overpriced for what it was as well.\n\nThe only reason I am giving this place 1 star is because I can't give 0.5 star....\n\nIf you're thinking of going to this place, your money would be better invested in a big mac..."], "2": ["I chose this place because the reviews on Yelp were decent and it was close to my hotel.  I must say that I was overwhelmingly disappointed with this restaurant.  I consider myself an amateur foodie and I'm always looking for a gem and this place was not even close.  The first problem I had with this place is that it was located in a dreary basement 2 stories below ground level.  On first entrance you feel like you've walked into a cheap diner from the 50's.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and that was where the niceties stopped.  Our waiter was quite unfriendly and he took 10 minutes to come and take our order even though the restaurant was basically empty on a Monday night.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the smoked meat sandwich hoping the food was better than the service.  Whoever said in their review that this was on par with Montreal's best smoked meat must be in the twilight zone or has had no experience tasting smoked meat in Montreal.  I realize that comparing any place to Schwartz's seems rather cliche but the truth is there is no comparison.  There are plenty of other places that don't serve overcooked smoked meat on terrible bread with tasteless mustard like Reuben's does.\n\nThe last point I will make is the fact that I ordered a garden salad instead of fries and they charged me $2.99 for the replacement.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this, though I think any restaurant should offer a replacement of fries with other side dishes at no charge, but the garden salad was absolutely horrendous.  It came in a cereal bowel and it was like I ordered 'ranch dressing with some romaine lettuce on the side'.  \n\nThey don't have any beer on tap so I ordered a heineken and my meal ended up costing almost $30 with tip.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had and I would not recommend eating here.  The only reason they get 2 stars is because they do serve you enough food to fill you up if you can stomach it.", "We were recommended this place by a tour guide as the husband wanted to try the smoked meat but regret taking his advice. Yes the sandwiches were huge but that doesn't negate the fact that they were incredibly dry and plain. Also, while I understand the fact that Montreal is in the midst of an English/French language battle, our waitress clearly despised us for not speaking French and we practically had to beg her for drinks and our check.", "I heard that Reuben's was a place I had to go to for Smoked Meat.\nI had high expectations but was disappointed. The smoked meat sandwiches were not as delicious as i expected them to be.\nI found out the next day that Reuben's is more known for their steak and that they don't make their own smoked meats.

I have no real complaints, but it was sort of middle of the road. We came here the day I moved all my junk into the new apartment and we were completely tired of walking.

You are already ingesting a ton of calories, what's a few more. Schwartz's is way too dry. Reuben's is buttery smooth and delicious and probably worse for you but Oh so good. The portions are huge. I always get the Jumbo Smoked meat. You have a hard time holding it in your hands.Today I ordered the large smoked meat poutine for 2 of my kids to share and I don't think I touched my own fries because I was always eating thier poutine.

The food OK but the service was awful. I would never come back here and never recommend to friends for any occasion. \n\nService: After ordering our food, we were taken to our table. We were given water initially but were never offered a refill for the entire meal thereafter (almost 3 hours). We ordered a 1/2L of wine but the first glasses didn't come until almost an hour into the service, just before the main course. Our appetizer was confused with another table's and the waiter almost seemed annoyed that we asked for our original order. The waiter spilled my girlfriend's second glass of wine when he delivered it and offered no apology, let alone a replacement. After each of the appetizer, main course, and dessert was delivered, the waiter abandoned us until the next course. After dessert, we sat there for 45 minutes with empty plates in front of us until a different waiter found us and escorted us out.\n\nFood: The caprese salad was decent, our pasta and chicken were OK. The chocolate cake tasted like it came from a supermarket and tasted nothing of chocolate.\n\nAmbience: At times it got really loud if there was a drunk/obnoxious group in the room. I was lucky to be sitting next to my girlfriend rather than across so at least we were able to talk to each other.

On choisit aussi les breuvages, bi\u00e8re, vin, etc.  La carte des vins est simple et limit\u00e9e mais il y a quelques vins qui sont corrects, \u00e0 mon avis.  Les serveurs, qui sont partiellement ou compl\u00e8tement aveugles, nous am\u00e8ne a notre table dans le noir et l'exp\u00e9rience commence.  \n\nEn tout et partout, nous nous sommes bien amus\u00e9s.  Il y a beaucoup de bruit (60 personnes peuvent  \u00eatre assises  par service).  Il semble que dans le noir les gens compensent en parlant plus fort.  Le service fut correcte, notre serveur et copropri\u00e9taire \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s plaisant.  La bouffe par contre \u00e9tait moyenne.  Rien de mauvais mais rien de sophistiqu\u00e9.

It does get very loud and is hard to carry a conversation at times due to the noise \n\nI would definitely recommend trying it but I would also recommend leveling your expectations a little before going , the food will be good but not stellar , the service will be average at best (banquet style service in the dark)"], "4": ["Totally cool experience.\n\nIt is hard to set an expectation for a first Dine in the Dark experience, the only things I could imagine beforehand is how I would spill my drinks, have a hard time cutting my food and stumble over chairs. When the time came, what awaited us is an totally unique and amazingly cool experience. \n\nThe restaurant is located right off St. Laurent Station on St. Catherine, the store's lighted area is the waiting area, where the hostess handed us a menu of choices where we pick one entree (appetizer), one main course (entree) and one dessert) for the gastronomique menu. Each person's orders is taken down and our names were called when the waitresses and the waiters are ready to usher us into the pitch dark dining area of the restaurant. The instructions are to put your hand on the shoulder of the person in front (with the wait staff leading) and form a human train through the darkness. The wait staff are blind and able to navigate in the dark extremely well. Once we were ushered inside,  a certain sense of panic poured in associated with going into a space completely devoid of light, rendering the sense I use the most completely useless. Within the few minutes of navigating to the hand washing area (yes, you will probably need to use your hand to eat at some point) and the table, the entire experience is about learning to listen and execute instructions carefully, feeling and anticipating turns through the hand-on-shoulder, and trusting completely. Once we arrived at our table, the waitress helped us feel our chairs, sat down and get acquainted with the location of utensils and napkins on the table. We were treated to our first drink, where it was placed right next to the wall divider on the left of the table - how clever, an absolute reference point for setting down the drinks. Our appetizers came shortly after, poking and picking up snails with a fork is something else in the dark, an action we are probably not even conscious of in the light, became a half guess-work, half dependent on transmission of feelings from tip of the fork. For a few times, where I 'thought' I picked up something, I was met with an empty fork. Oops. It was also quite cool to only realize what you are eating after it's already inside your mouth. The snails (with mushrooms) were quite good, not overly cheesy or exceptionally greasy. The main course was a little more challenging, not only did we need to pick up what's in our plate, we also need to cut it, pick up the proper piece, and sharing a taste with the other person became a creatively almost impossible task. After practically picking up my veal scallopini whole and taking bites out of it, the veggies and potatoes almost became too impossible. I start feeling my way around my beans and resorted to using my fingers. Boyfriend came up with a creative way of passing me a piece of his filet mignon by meeting my hand along the side of the table. Yay, success! We figured something out by ourselves. The meal was great but the experience we spent between each meal was more than awesome, we spent time analyzing the differences in what we are feeling eating in the dark and eating in light, which dishes would be most difficult to eat in the dark (we think it's Pho), imagining and making up stories, and creating and trying different ways to do various things without using our eyes, like feeling each other's facial features, looking for each other's hands and having so much laughs. At the end of the meal, we were pretty confident in having a cup of coffee in the dark and managing our table top to not spill anything.\n\nThe food was great though just having the experience was much more than worth it. Our waitress was attentive and helped guiding us through our entire meal, we loved her. The experience was definitely one of a kind and quite amazing, and I came out cleaner than a brand new napkin because of all the attention I paid to carefully navigating through my plate.", "J'ai eu la plus grande   frousse de ma vie  !!!

I had bought a coupon for us from Groupon during the summer but with school and work we only had the chance to go now (3 days before the coupon expired-phew!)  I had been very excited to go but also a bit wary since I didn't know how I would react once I was in the room.\n\nLocated close to St Laurent metro, Dans Le Noir offers diners a very unique experience.  When you first arrive, you are welcomed in a lobby where you put your coats away and put your purses and valuables in a locker.  You are then able to look over the menu and give a waiter your order.\n\nWhen they are ready, your name is called and this is when the real experience begins.  You meet your waiter,  (we had a gentleman named Ricardo-very nice) and she/he then leads you into the room.  You have to hold onto his shoulder and listen to where he tells you to go since you can't see AT ALL.  He seats you at your table, then tells you where your utensils are on the table.\n\nRight away, you notice that you start to speak louder while you slowly adjust to the fact that you can't even see your hand in front of you.  The staff promptly brings you a drink (sangria made with white wine) and soon after your appetizer.  For the full menu, go here.\n\nI chose to have the caprese salad and Anthony had the crabcake.  It was so strange how even though you may have had that meal numerous times throughout your life- it tastes different.  Anthony said his crabcake almost tasted like mashed potatoes.\n\nSomething that took some time to get used to was the fact that you couldn't see your food, nor where you were cutting!  You just had to hope that you were doing an okay enough job to not be making a mess on the table, your lap or your face.  It definitely added a comedic tone to the whole thing.\n\nFor the main course, I had the Veal Scalopini and Ant had the filet mignon, both of which were tasty and had a side of vegetables and potatoes.  We decided to order a half a bottle of the house wine and it accompanied the meal very well.\n\nWe finished it off with dessert; I had the Chocolate Mousse which I am still craving and Ant had the Cheese Cake.  By this time, I was greatly enjoying the experience.  It was as though time and space did not exist- you almost felt like you, yourself did not exist anymore- it was surreal.\n\nOnce you are finished, you are led back into the light filled lobby to get your jacket and adjust to being able to see again.  We had seen many people come out looking squinty eyed with food on their shirts but Ant and I had done alright!  I had made it through the whole meal with my knife and fork and Ant well- he enjoyed it all with his hands which is perfectly fine!  Who would know right?\n\nOverall, it is an experience that I believe everyone should partake in.  I've always had much respect for the blind but after this- it really sinks in how different living is for them and the respect increases.  I loved the experience so much I wish I could go all the time.  For those of you who think, \"Just eat at home with all of the lights turned off..\"  it is NOT the same thing.  Leave your house, away from all of your electronic devices, all of the noise created by the machines you may have,  just disconnect- it really is an amazing experience.  I could not stop staying it throughout the whole night- it really is just simply amazing.", "After an hour of preparation and make up, my boyfriend surprised me with taking me Dans le Noir for diner.\n\nWe both took the surprise menu, allowing the Chef to tailor the diner from the list according to our diets (vegetarian for one and dairy free for the other).\n\nI had the Fillet Mignon that I ate with my finger, cutting being difficult when you don't see, and BOY WAS IT GOOD !\n\nIf you're a meat eater, it's a wild and rare experience to eat such tender meat with your hands while no one can witness your primal adventure, making the feelings more vivid.\n\nI'm glad I had the occasion to try!"]}}, "oRdXlz5pAcGUJ4snYzUbAw": {"reviews": {"4": ["This is a brand new restaurant which opened last week.

Spaghetti was well cooked but not fresh (YES! NOT FRESH MADE PASTA IN A TRUE ITALIAN RESTAURANT), the tomate sauce was soo acid that it needed another 2 hours of cooking minimum. It tasted like a soup can or the bottom of a dishwasher water..it's like there was no garlic, no basil and needed more olive oil to make it more silky since it was a bit granny. The parmigiana veal was not freshly made because the crumb was soggy, the veal was tough and overcooked...well a Michelina's at 2.39$ at the grocery store would be more satisfied than that.

Speaking of the food, it was boring and just totally bland. The meat was overcooked, everything was under seasoned, and more of less every dish had an uninspired mushy quality. I would have given this place one star, but the wine selection was good and the interior was really lovely. Overall though - avoid."], "3": ["Although all the dishes were nicely plated, the food lacked soul.

Indeed, critics in both Le Devoir and Le Journal de Montreal have already heaped effusive praise upon the spot, which is what drew my attention to it in the first place.\n\nSet in the converted basement of a church, the space is aglow in dim, yellow light that accentuates the warm exposed wood. The restaurant serves what I would describe as \"elevated esoteric local,\" in that everything you will be served - with wine and coffee the lone exceptions - comes sourced from Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime provinces.  So that means no olive oil, no lemons, and no pepper will be used in any capacity.  In contrast, you will find intriguing things like mushrooms foraged in the woods, leaves of grasses plucked from Atlantic coast beaches, and herbs found growing in the wild.  Russell works closely with foraging company Gaspesie Sauvage - if you're interested, go to their Web site and check out their photo gallery to see some the things that will likely end up on your plate in some capacity.\n\nThe menu changes every month or so, but is inspired by the season.  For a very reasonable $45 you will get a four-course prix-fixe dinner that includes two appetizers, a choice of two mains, and a choice of a sweet dessert or a cheese plate.  You can also match each course with individualized wine pairings for an additional $40/pp, but in my view you're just as well off buying a decent bottle (and they have a nice little list) for around the same amount and going from there.\n\nBut what of the food?  Well, that's the thing.  Throughout the four courses of dinner, I realized I was consistently tasting things or looking at the presentation and thinking, \"Now that's interesting!\" or \"I've never had this combination of flavors before!\" but never, \"wow, this is absolutely AMAZING!\"  My palate truly felt more like it was going through an academic exercise rather than simply delighting in what it was tasting. On the whole, the food was innovative as could be, yet still, undeniably, just a bit odd.\n\nMy recommendation: if you're willing to eat things that really can't be categorized, check out Candide's site and take a look at their menu to first validate that their limited options of the moment appeal to you (even if you don't recognize some of the ingredients).  Then, enter your dining experience with an open mind; even if you remain unconvinced by what you ate at meal's end, at the very least you will have been served by a passionate staff and chef dedicated to what I can appreciate is a more sustainable way of cooking and eating, and in a cozy and relatively unpretentious venue, to boot.", "Ate their at the end of January. Very charming spot. Service was excellent. Food is closest to the esthetic that you would find in San Francisco ( where I am from) than in anyplace I have been to in Montreal. Great room and location though hard to find. I will definitely go back and look forward to seeing the change in the seasons through the chefs eyes.", "Four of us came here for dinner last night and it was absolutely excellent. Great atmosphere and great food. I had read some reviews that complained the food was bland. None of us had anything that could be considered bland. All of the food had excellent flavor and a great blending of flavors. The wine pairings were interesting and just right. Well done. Service was attentive and excellent. \n\nCandide's philosophy is to use locally sourced food from Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces. This seems to be working well for them and I would like to return when they have more local produce. \n\nWe were able to have a fun time and talk and the people around us seemed to be able to do the same. In other words, you could hear your table company ions speaking and you did not hear others. Great sound control. \n\nThe only down side is that it's very hard to find. The restaurant is at the rear of a former church and there is no signage at the front of the church indicating where the restaurant is located. The taxi took us around the block a few times and then our friend phoned the restaurant and they gave us the information we needed to get there. \n\nThe four of us left very happy with everything and sincerely hoping that this new restaurant (opened in January) makes a go of it ...

When a few of our party weren't feeling adventurous enough to try venison hearts, they offered to bring out venison shoulder or a vegetarian alternative instead without missing a beat!  \n\nThe food was plated and brought to us in a spectacular fashion. The timing between each course was perfect and the plates were reasonably sized for a 4-course meal. The food was generally delicious (the venison shoulder was a ~tad~ on the chewy side but still perfectly seasoned) and clearly put together with so much thought and love.

Lima beans will never interest me, the morels were not as flavourful as I had hope - but the quail was perfect. 2 of our party had the duck - very good, and one had the sweetbreads, which were reportedly very good, but the serving was quite small.

We were seated outdoors on the sidewalk under the awning for dinner on 23 July 2014. The waitress was very polite yet efficient with her duties. I had a glass of Moet and a classic caesar salad. My Darling had a croque monsieur with a green salad. It was absolutely charming. My salad was exquisitely flavored and was really something special.

Worst idea ever.  Montreal is a great city....in the summer time.  It must have been 0 or possibly negative degrees the entire long weekend.  We ended up ducking into bars and restaurants just to get out of the cold.  After a bit of walking around St. Catherine, we spotted Les 3 Brasseurs.  Looked like a decent place, but it was packed to the gills.  No luck there, not even at the bar.  Decided to stop in the next available place.  Enter Guido & Angelina.\n\nThis questionably named restaurant seems like your average, contemporary Italian restaurant.  It was pretty empty, which normally would have been enough for me to look elsewhere, but it was cold and I was hungry.  Despite being pretty empty, they had at least 5 employees gathered at the corner of the bar looking at a laptop.  One of them noticed us standing by the hostess table after a few minutes and walked over.  She had a half beleaguered, half confused look on her face, as if we had come to the front door of her home, looking to get seated.  To the hostess: I apologize for pulling you away from your group facebook/youtube/shopping session.  We exchanged a few uncomfortable pleasantries found our way to the bar.  The menu was pretty expansive, but with typical Italian fair.  Nothing exotic, but all the classics were represented.  I decided to get the bruschetta and crab cakes for our appetizer.  After ordering, we were pleasantly surprised that the food was prepared on the fast side.  I guess that is to be expected, considering there were maybe three other tables of people in the place.  Unfortunately, the speedy preparation of the food did not compensate for the total lack of flavor and authenticity.  The bruschetta was covered in a tomato salsa type topping with absolutely no seasoning.  It tasted like raw tomatoes on toast.   The crab cakes were a little undercooked, being somewhat gooey on the inside.  They too lacked any discernable flavor outside of the bland breading on the outside.  If I had my eyes closed, I would have guessed them to be fried oatmeal balls.  These oatmeal balls were accompanying by a \"salad\", the likes of which could only be described as rediscovered scraps that had spent time on the floor behind the refrigerator.  The vegetables were dried out and dirty.  We each had a taste of both dishes, but left good portions of each on the plate.  I really should have stopped right there, but the prospect of heading back out into the frozen tundra of downtown Montr\u00e9al to find a new place to eat was the deciding factor to tuff it out.  Being as cold as it was, I was thinking heavy, rich food to warm me up.  I noticed they were serving carbonara.  That seems like something basic enough that it would be passable anywhere.   I was wrong.  First and most importantly, the noodles were the worst noodles I've ever had.  I'm no aficionado about pasta, but I do care a great deal about how it is cooked.  They served the carbonara with spaghetti that was unusually white in color.  It was either really overcooked or was of such low quality that it lacked both texture and any wheat flavor.  It reminded me of Vietnamese rice sticks, which are great for their application, but shouldn't ever touch Italian sauces.  The sauce was cream based, and as far as I could tell, did not have any egg in it.  It lacked cohesion with the rest of the ingredients, where one bite I'd get a raw garlic taste, another I would get a raw parsley taste--all within a very soupy, bland sauce.  It was almost as if someone microwaved cream with pancetta, garlic, parsley, and pepper in a bowl and poured it over the pasta.  This was not carbonara.  I struggled through about a quarter of the dish, repeating in my mind that I didn't in fact order carbonara--that this was a Canadian dish that I've never had before.  It got me through enough to not feel starving anymore.  \n\nOn the plus side, the bar tender who was serving us was very pleasant, albeit a little distracted with restocking.  She mixed quite a few drinks for us."], "2": ["This place is wonderful if you enjoy microwaved dishes.

Yes the portions were large, but bigger sure as hell doesn't mean better in this case.", "I have never understood the hype around this place.  The food is average at best.  I've had cream-based pesto here which is just nasty and not authentic at all.  Even the basic tomato sauce is pretty bad.  I find it very acidic and overall lacking in flavour.", "We had to eat and escape the tropical heat, and L'academie was dead in front of us. I loved the ambiance, chic lime-green downstairs, gray/raspberry combo upstairs.. They have a bunch of great deals for lunch: 13$ mussels with fries and salad, or the swift 10$ lunch special (soup + seashell/calamari and 2 other combos). There is a wide choice of mussels even at such low price, and you get a good liter of 'em. Delicious. Don't go for the seashell though, it's out of the IGA frozen aisle. Nothing to write home about, but for 10$, I'm picking hairs.\nThe low rating stands mainly for the service, of which there is none. Your hipster waitress will stay behind her tiny counter, checking out the computer, not knowing what the menu is..The place is pretty understaffed, and the wait is long. I was underwhelmed by the paper tablecloth, hiding massive wine stains on the underlying tablecloth. Mmmm.."], "3": ["I've never been the the L'Academie at St-Denis, so I cannot compare. I will assume the quality is comparable. I went to L'acadmie hearing not so great reviews, however I am one to never trust the opinions of the masses(we'll only on Yelp :P).\n\nFood Quality/Price - 2.5/5\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirstly, I  want to mention that this is a BYOW (bring your wine). I adore this concept, mainly because I detest paying the premium when ordering wine at a restaurant. However, this is how many restaurants make the lion's share of their revenues. \n\nThat being said majority of BYOW restaurants are usually sub-par in the food quality because they cut corners to beef up profit margins. Unfortunately, L'acadamie is no exception, they food is \"palatable\", yet the prices are fair. Its saving grace is that it is a BYOW.\n\nAmbiance/Service - 4/5\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe ambiance and service are great. The food was served in a timely manner and the wait staff was courteous. Also, I loved the novel idea of actually showing patrons the desert before they order directly at their table. The ambiance was appropriate for  a mid tier crescent street \"hot spot\" and as decorations were not too garish making for a decent dining experience.\n\nOverall - B-\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI would go back to L'acadamie, solely because its BYOW. The take home message of this review is that if your looking for great food look elsewhere. However, if your looking for a good time and place you can bring your own wine(or beer), L'acadamie will fit the bill.", "So as I am still somewhat new to Montreal, I have to keep reminding me of these places that let you bring your own wine.  l'Academie is one of those places.  Great deal to bring your own wine, but you need to remember ahead of time.  I was meeting three others and realized I needed wine so took a walk for a few blocks to Sainte-Catherine & Drummond to find an SAQ to buy my wine at...no big deal, could use the exercise!\n\nRegarding the meal itself, I have to say I was a little disappointed.  There is nothing specifically wrong with this place, but nothing stood out either.  The food was average, the service was good.  I started with garlic escargot that was decent enough, but not distinctive in any way.  I then ate seared tuna for my main dish.  Again, mediocre.   Price is pretty good, however, compared to many restaurants in the area,", "How often do you stumble across a BYOW (bring your own wine) restaurant?  As a Torontonian, I haven't!\n\nAlthough that was not what lured me to Restaurant l'Academie, its an interesting concept.  It is a multi-storey, house-converted restaurant with simple yet elegant decor.  Exposed brick, and white paneled walls makes you feel like you're the home of a housewife who has all the time in the world to fuss over all the elegant details of her humble abode.\n\nThe waiter here is probably one of the shyest I've ever met, but he was polite and very friendly.  The food here is French/Italian and the prices are great for the dining experience you get.  I would probably throw down roughly the same amount for a less than stellar meal at Jack Astor's. \n\nWe started off with Escargots and Fried Calamari. Escargot was rather oily and the calamari, albeit having a light batter was not crispy.\n\nFor mains I opted for the Sole Meuni\u00e8re and William T. opted for the Linguini Vongole which was a garlic and tomato, white wine pasta.\n\nThe fish came with orange cauliflower, carrots and potatoes. It was tender but I felt it was rather bland. The linguini was fantastic. It was a clam pasta and the pasta was very yummy!\n\nOverall good value for your money and great service."], "4": ["A Bring Your Own Wine with a Sunday - Wednesday special is good in my books! \nThe food is good, especially when you can accompany it with as much wine as you choose to bring with you!

So I definitely recommend the one on Crescent!\nI plan on going there this week! :)", "I've eaten here only a handful of times, but it's a winner. Every person I have recommended it to, LOVES it. Like they really love it. They call me and go on and on about how much they loved it. Here's why: it's a fantastic multi-storey restaurant at St. Denis and Duluth, right next to a SAQ. (Actually, that SAQ is now closed...but there's one kiddie-corner...rejoice - Montrealers now how to roll.)\n\nThis would be a good time to mention Montreal is huge on BYOW - bring your own wine. Just look for \"approtez votre vin\". And unlike the rest of Canada, they don't charge a corking fee, nor do they stare at you with their judgy little eyes. The Quebecois simply uncork and pour. It's genius - why can't every restaurant do it. \n\nNow that you have your bottle (or bottles), slip next door and get a table. L'Academie is best described as boisterous. Everyone needs a fail-safe restaurant. This would be it.", "We ate here twice. It's a great little French/Italian restaurant and the end of the bustling Rue Crescent. Prices are reasonable for the portion size. We only had pasta but it was great. Desserts were good too."], "5": ["I love this restaurant.  Its modern and classy decor.  This is a nice romantic dinner date or a good place to bring a small group of friends. You bring your own bottle of wine.  The mussels are yummy and that's all I go for.  All the flavors are good.  I usually like the white creamy cheese soup one- Rockafello and comes with yummy fries to dip. They're known for the mussels.  Wednesdays are half off mussels ($13) fyi!", "We loved this restaurant on a recent trip to Montreal. In fact, we ate their 3 times on a five day trip!   I was surprised to find that this was one of several locations.  It has all the charm of small downtown BYOB, and delicious fresh baguettes served with quality Italian food.", "Excellent Mussels and the BYOB, Sun-Wed special of $12 for pasta/mussles and soup or salad is unbeatable.

The Maitre d' and our waiter's demeanour can best be described as surely and I immediately felt unwelcome. We were seated toward the rear of the restaurant near the  kitchen and seemed to be directly in line with some sort of cooling fan that cast a chill on our entire evening. \n\nWe were a group of 3 and ordered the Salmon Tartare, Beef Short Ribs & the Bavette. The Bavette was the clear winner. The food was good, but not mind blowing in any way. \n\nThroughout the entire evening we felt as if were causing some sort of inconvenience to our waiter who was extremely unattentive. In addition to being generally unfriendly the service we received was not on par with this level of restaurant. The bread was very slow to arrive at our table, 2 people at our table were served their plates and then we waited about 5 minutes for the 3rd dish to arrive. For my friend who ordered the Bavette the waiter did not think to bring her a steak knife so she was stuck trying to cut through it with a butter knife. When we completed our dinner we sat around for an extended period of time and no one asked us if we would like the check. After I flagged someone down the bill arrived quickly and then we were left sitting with my credit card on the table for another 15 minutes without anyone coming by to process our payment. Again I had to flag down one of the staff. Not once did someone say 'sorry for the delay' or apologize in any manner. \n\nThe restaurant was reasonably busy, but well staffed so I can't blame any of the above on a shortage of staff or excessive stress on the staff. \n\nOur overall experience at Grinder was poor. Never did we feel that our presence in the restaurant was appreciated in any manner.

Luckily for me, my parents shared this gem of a restaurant with me  years ago :)\n\nSo first, don't expect fancy decor because I don't think they've redecorated since they opened the restaurant 30 years ago. This is a really traditional, family-style restaurant with no bells and whistles. The focus is on the FOOD. If you get there past 5pm on a weekend, you can expect a line-up.  That said, you can call ahead to order takeout.\n\nIn my opinion, Elio makes the best pizza in town. They're not cheap on the toppings, and I find their all-dressed to be a well-rounded mix of pepperoni, bell pepper, mushrooms and cheese. The crust is perfect - not too thick. I also appreciate that their crust is never wet like some places!  Their pasta dishes are equally good, with my favorite being the cavatelli. I'm not sure if they make their own pasta but if not, the guy they get it from does a real good job of giving me that illusion!  Elio's sauce is so good that I never leave the resto without buying a jar or two. Yup, Elio stocks the front fridge with sauce and a few pastas for those of us who want to bring some home. \n\nElio offers a few different pastas and sauces that you can 'mix and match' if you like. They are very generous with their portions, so you'll leave there with a Buddha belly and quite possibly, a doggy bag. As well, their prices are super affordable. \n\nWhat are you waiting for?

Music was loud so was the kitchen noise and chefs talking to each other.  The manager (assume he was), told us that 5 table (yup, a big 5) were complaining that we were too loud.

We paid and went elsewhere to have desert and coffee.\n\nIf you're a quiet party, you might enjoy.", "I'll be honest - despite all the hype and rumors of amazing food, I was ready to write this place off after two failed attempts at making a reservation. Why? Because whoever oversees email and social media correspondence completely underwhelmed me with their indifference and lack of interest in making even the smallest attempt to accommodate me.   We don't need to get into the nitty gritty but my unsolicited advice to Tuck Shop, is to find someone with some social skills and have that guy respond to client queries. I ended up going with a friend who unexpectedly (and successfully) made a reservation. \n\nLocation: St. Henri, where gentrification is madly underway.  The nearest subways are St. Henri (10-min walk) and Lionel-Groulx (15-20-min walk).\n\nService: Excellent. The staff were super friendly, accommodating and pretty quick, making the experience a great one. We went on a Tuesday night at 6pm; it was quiet to start, but business quickly picked up and by the time we left, we had a full house. \n\nFood: Incredibly, deliciously, amazing. Seriously - you have to go. \n\nStarters:\n\nCrispy pork belly, aged Gouda, oyster mushrooms. My date loved it. \n\nCrispy stuffed zucchini blossoms, peaches, fennel, red onion, pine nuts, lemon vinaigrette. The blossoms were stuffed with (I think) ricotta, which was super flavorful. This medley of flavors was delicious. \n\nMains:\n\nButcher's cut, french fries, Chimichurri. I don't eat steak but I could see that those fries looked REAL good! My date really enjoyed this dish. The steak was perfectly cooked and juicy. \n\nHomemade pork and porcini ravioli w/brown butter sage sauce. One word: YUM! I loved this dish. The portion was just right for me so at the end of the meal, I didn't feel super stuffed. Flavor-wise, the sage sauce was rich and flavorful. It reminded me a little of brown gravy. Totally dee-licious.\n\nDessert: \nPecan pie and peach pie. Both were fresh and excellent. I'm not even a pie person and I really enjoyed my peach pie. I wonder if they'll sell me a whole pie? :)\n\nPrice: It's up there - my meal was $50 and I didn't have any drinks or coffee.\n\nOverall, I loved the space and the vibe of this place. They have an extensive wine list and a seasonal menu that changes whenever it suits the chef, making this little gem a favorite with the locals. \n\nThe downside: We were thoroughly enjoying ourselves until the yuppy/hipster doofus couple arrived with their kid in tow, and what looked like the entire contents of her toy chest. What followed next was a noisy and lengthy display of douchebaggery courtesy of the father, that no one should have to endure. These people had zero respect for us (we were right next to them) and seemed to forget that they were in a restaurant, not their living room.

Thankfully I scored reservations at the last minute  for the same evening and was seriously looking forward to an awesome meal out with excellent company.\n\nReader, the food was impeccable. Not a bad note anywhere. I ordered the much recommended crispy pork belly and there's a reason why everyone is raving about it: it's THAT good. Melt-in-your-mouth perfection sitting in a smooth creamy sauce. It will definitely whet your appetite for more! The hanger steak was just as divine. A simple, juicy steak, which I ordered medium, and it came as medium, smothered with chimichurri sauce, that wonderful South American parsley and garlic condiment, along with just perfect, crispy homemade fries. The pecan pie was rich, creamy and just the right amount of sweet. I was loving every bite.  \n\nEverything was going along swimmingly until the young yuppie family from hell showed up next to our table. Bringing your one-year old along with her her toy trunk to a popular eatery is NOT cool and this is where Tuck Shop loses their stars. I can understand wanting to accommodate your clients, yes,  but accommodating them at the expense of other clients, no. \n\nHad circumstances been different, I would have given Tuck Shop a full five stars, no problem and without any hesitation but given the experience last night, I just can't.\n\n[Memo to young hipster/yuppie parents: I get that you want to continue the lifestyle you had before the kids came along, I really do. But there is no way on God's good earth a crying 1 year old or 2 year old will ever understand what eating at a popular new restaurant really means. A kid at that age is just thinking cartoons and sugar.

Having been there now, I'm convinced he's right and am grateful to have had the experience.\n\n(Edit - I now know what a \"tuck shop\" is)\n\nThe restaurant is tiny, but manages to squeeze quite a few tables into the place; I'm guessing there's seating for about 40. It's loud, both from customers and music.\n\nWhen we arrived we were informed a table wasn't ready yet and were eventually seated at one of two bars, this one facing the kitchen. After ordering cocktails and sipping on them for about 5 minutes, the hostess came to deliver us to.... the other bar. After we looked at her rather funny and asked why we were being moved to the other bar, she sat us at a table. (Never did get an explanation there.)\n\nOur friendly waiter went through the specials of the day, and we settled on the soup for my friend and the salad for me for starters. Neither one were anything worth writing home about. While I wasn't expecting much from the salad (it's a salad, after all), the soup could have been better. For our mains my friend went with one of the fish of the day dishes, which was a cod that he loved. I went for the braised lamb & gnocchi - the gnocchi was outstanding and soaked up all the love, while the lamb was so tender I was afraid the loud music was going to cause it to fall apart. Unfortunately after all that we had no room left for dessert.\n\nThe service on the whole was good, but we did have to fight to flag our waiter down after dinner.

It's small but cozy, and the atmosphere is industrial crossed with baroque/trendy. Very casual and very relaxed. The service is really friendly and the waitstaff are cool and unpretentious. The food is delicious - we sampled all sorts of things, from deep fried okra to delicious rare steak with shitaake mushrooms and wine sauce, to seafood and lentil salad, to trendy new classics like pork belly. Decent wine selection as well, and the prices are not unreasonable at all.\n\nHighly recommended!!!"], "5": ["It's in a sketchy area, but it's upscale and lovely. A small bistro type restaurant.

I'll be back for sure!", "I was happy to venture into a slightly sketchy area of Montreal for the opportunity to dine at the highly recommended Tuck Shop.  (After living in Baltimore and Brooklyn, I fear no neighborhood.)  I am in love with the decor/design of the restaurant.  It's polished, slightly industrial,  but still warm and classic.  The tomatoes that have been jarred by hand (in house) are scattered around the restaurant reminding you that this kitchen obviously cares about the food it prepares and they will not be taking any short cuts.  The wonderful dishes we were served only corroborated this notion.\n\nWe started our meal with the pork belly and the Thai BBQ rib with green papaya salad.  The pork belly was unparalleled.  It doesn't get any better than this.  I'm actually at a loss for words on how to describe it.  You HAVE to try it.  I would have liked the Thai ribs to be more spicy, but I understand that not everyone enjoys very spicy food like I do. They were cooked impeccably.\n\nFor mains: My husband ordered the seared arctic char with smoked bacon, a mustard/maple sauce, roasted potatoes, pickled beets, pureed carrots and a soft boiled egg.  I don't know how this combination came to fruition, but I was floored by the flavors.  I don't like fish and my husband had to fight me off from stealing his dinner.  One would think the ingredients would have to compete in this dish, but they got along flawlessly.  For less adventurous eaters, the caesar salad, double stuffed potato, and the AAA strip loin in a red wine sauce is a solid choice.  This is a classic meal that everyone and their grandfather has enjoyed, but you will not be bored with Tuck Shop's offering of this perennial crowd pleaser.  (I ended up trying to steal part of this meal as well.)  I ordered the braised veal cheeks with pine nuts, grilled fennel, crispy polenta and broccoli rabe.  Tender, succulent, perfect.  The crispy polenta was a prime platform for the veal cheeks.  This may be my new favorite cut when dining out, but will it be as good at other restaurants? I'm afraid of being disappointed.  I'm going to have to ask Tuck Shop to open a location in Brooklyn solely for my benefit.       \n\nThank you, Tuck Shop, for an amazing meal.  I will be back as soon as possible.", "Getting an RSVP at one of Montreal's best restaurants has become difficult. Liverpool House? Three-week wait. Le Hangar? Sure there's room, if you want to eat before 5:30pm or after 10:30pm. Bremner? No matter how early you plan, making an RSVP is difficult if no one answers the phone or calls you back - well done on joining Opentable. Ah yes, planning a night out is currently necessary even in Montreal, especially since popular restaurant trends promote smaller, cozier, bustling restaurants that fill up fast.\n\nThat's how I finally ended up at Tuck Shop. I've wanted to try this place for a while, so I called a week early to reserve for a group, and opted for the dinner-table-style menu that includes 4 appetizers and 2 mains (a steal at $45 per person). A taste of everything for everyone? Aww yeahhh.\n\nWe started with a salad - white beets, coriander, mango, arugula, radish, cucumbers and parmesan. It was yummy and refreshing, especially with the tart lemony dressing.\n\nNext, we had the most delicious smoked salmon ever. At Tuck Shop, the salmon is wild, house cured and smoked, and comes with \"potato rosti\", trout caviar and cr\u00e8me fraiche. And I repeat - delicious.\n\nOur third appetizer consisted of cheese tacos. Made with fried mozzarella, coriander, corn and lettuce, they were soft and delightful. Awesome, because tacos can easily be flavourless. It might be surprising, but it's true.\n\nOur last appetizer included caramelized salmon with bok choy, root veggies and quinoa. The salmon was crispy on the outside and prepared to the point of a perfect soft pink on the inside. The veggies were cooked but crunchy. Delish.\n\nHaving forgotten how many dishes were included in our menu, we thought our meal was over. Lo and behold, the waitress came over to tell us that our mains were on their way. Oh baby! These included the most mouthwatering jerk chicken accompanied by black bean pur\u00e9e and fried okra. It was spicy and juicy and everything jerk chicken should be. Perfection.\n\nFinally, our last main consisted of hanger steak with chimichurri, wild mushrooms and rapini. Again, so good. And the best part? We didn't even have to say \"medium-rare\".\n\nWe wrapped up our meal with three delicious desserts to share. Tiramisu, warm apple pie, and caramel fleur de sel \"cheesecake\". The tiramisu was good, but not something to rave about. It's ok - a tiny bit of sub-perfection makes Tuck Shop human. The apple pie was amazing - warm and so satisfying with its crumbly crust and just-sweet-enough apple center.  Needless to say, our favorite was the caramel fleur de sel \"cheesecake\" that was more of a silken cheesy-caramel-y-salty-cream than a cheesecake. Whoa.\n\nYes, I absolutely loved Tuck Shop. It made me think of a smaller Orignal and a non-pretentious Garde Manger. The music was super fun (Tom Petty and Gypsy Kings, anyone?) and added to the bon-vivant vibe that permeated the small restaurant. The service was good and the food was varied and delicious. I do hope that Tuck Shop's tables continue to be difficult to book for a while - it would certainly be well deserved.\n\n\nFood 9.5/10, Atmosphere 9.5/10, Pretty people 9/10, Music (superfun, goodvolume) 9.5/10, Service 8.5/10.\n\n\nPictures: http://www.belledenuitmontreal.com/posts/tuck-shop/"]}}, "Q3FnqSak00hiTQB1bO2uTQ": {"reviews": {"2": ["So we called up Gus restaurant, spoke to David Ferguson on a Friday afternoon to get a possible reservation for the same evening.

We really appreciated that she explained each item in detail, although we would have liked to have actual menus in our hands rather than having to look at a chalk board at the other end of the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered 2 Caesar salads and one gravlax for appetizers. The kitchen was kind enough to make one Caesar without anchovies as our son has an allergy. The dressing was delicious on both salads and the gravlax was also very nice.\n\nFor our main dishes, we had one tartare de cheval, one bavette de boeuf and one pork chop. The tartare was served with frites, grilled bread and a side order of grilled vegetables. It was very good, but the tartare (albeit a huge portion) could have used some acid (maybe a little mustard). The bavette de boeuf was served with a gratin of potatoes and was quite tasty. The pork chop was served with mashed potatoes (lovely and smooth and well-seasoned) and a jus with tomatillos. The dish was really well-balanced but the pork chop was overcooked without even a hint of pink.\n\nAll in all, the meal was good but not a good as we had anticipated after reading reviews on Yelp.

Firstly bc it's in a part of my neighbourhood where I already love to spend time drinking and dining, picniking and knocking down pins; secondly because wise foodie friends from Enroute had tipped me off to this being the eventual new homebase for the crew from Jolifou a few months back; and thirdly because sometimes I dream in Surf n Turf. \n\nMy dreams were not disappointed. \n\nBased on my experience last night I have the following tips:\n\n1. Sit at the bar, in the middle, so you are right in front of Dave Ferguson and can watch him make lovely food and run his kitchen and generally be charming and friendly and bossed up. There are hooks under the bar for your bags, and a coat rack up front, and the bar is wide and nicely spaced, so all will be well here. \n\n2. Eat Caesar Salad. It's served in a good big bowl for sharing, with hunks of lovely toasted bread, capers, and pancetta with chillis on the side. The dressing is made in his grandmother's wooden bowl. I can't do justice the detail work that goes into the hows and whys of the homemade dressing, but it's all worth the time it takes and is comforting to watch. \n\n3. Surf n' Turf for two, but could easily feed three with apps. Do it. Beautiful thick Nevada steak, juicy and soft and perfect, under a pile of giant shrimp and scallops in a perfect beurre blanc with poblano chillis. \n\n4. Use the jars of homemade hot sauce and pickled chillis. Try them all, especially Mechant Carotte which is sweet backed up with Scotch Bonnet heat and is my new favourite thing. \n\n5. Tarte tatin. I can't even talk about it. My heart is too full. They pour Jameson on top right before serving which seems designed to make a girl like me swoon. \n\nThe joint is brand new so they are still getting their legs under them and figuring out the room, but it's warm, comfortable, elegant without being at all fussy. And as he pointed out, it's less than half the size of Jolifou, ie; small enough that David and Joshua (his wildly talented poet of a sous chef) are generally working on only one or two tickets at a time, and so have the brain space to chat and smile and hopefully enjoy the lovely experiences they are making all around them.\n\nI look forward to tucking in to Gus for wine and French Onion soup soon and often to ride out the end of the snowy season, and to seeing what they do come summer. Welcome to the neighbourhood!", "In a party of 4. Two of us had poisson du jour, scallops (yea I know), which were grilled & served on bed of polenta. Excellent. Scallops done to perfection & polenta creamy with slight nutty (hazelnut?) flavour.  We also had red beets & grilled red peppers. both a pleasure to consume.  One minor complaint, the Green salad was tasty with very good dressing but the type of arugula was mostly stem making it a challenge to eat (coming from someone who is not a picky eater).  Our first time to Gus but I don't expect our last, & I'll certainly recommend to friends heading to Montreal.", "Really enjoyed my experience at Gus.\n\nThe restaurant is small so an intimate setting which is great, we sat at the bar, and we had a blast with the chef and waiter, very nice people and great conversation.\n\nAs for the food, we shared the octopus as an entr\u00e9e, it was perfectly cooked and tender, worthy of any spanish restaurant.

It was a cloying bad taste that put me off the rest of the plate and was a shame. \n\nThe server was charming, friendly and sweet but forgot to mention that they were out of the mussels,  or that the bavette was going to come with green beans instead of the kale choux on the menu (the menu is on a chalkboard, why not just update it?)

The decor is beautiful inside, the lighting and ambiance is very cozy. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by a very welcoming host, and the service was pretty much spot on. I ordered the artic char, which was well cooked but nothing mind blowing.\n\nBad : My boyfriend ordered the goat cheese croquette, which turned out to be a big piece of breaded goat cheese. It was good, but half the portion would've sufficed. It was just a but too heavy, and the flavor was just too overpowering. We also ordered the mushroom ravioli, which sounds better than it taste. The ravioli was a bit under cooked, and the creme sauce was a bit too strong, which you can barely even taste the mushrooms. \n\nBottom line : the terrace looks fantastic, which is probably great for summer.

The pappardelle was cheesey, but not too cheesey, and in my opinion, was better than the rigatoncini, which was good as well. \n\nThe only reason why Bice doesn't warrant 5 stars is because the wait staff is made up of young boys, who are either overly eager, clearing our dishes and cutlery as soon as we had put it down, or super forgetful.

This is not the sort of place I would usually bring my toddler to, as it is very upscale and elegant, but for an early supper out we thought, \"why not ?\" as I was dying to try this place on a recent visit to Montreal. The waitstaff was more than friendly and accommodating and never made us feel out of place. We opted to stay indoors as it was a particularly chilly evening, but they have the most beautiful terrace for warmer evenings. The inside of the restaurant has a contemporary/modern elegance set in a neutral color palette, with comfortable tables and banquette seating around the perimeter.

I am fed up, really FED UP about these star chefs in Montreal getting all this glory and the royal treatment for cooking homefood. If I want to eat homefood, I'll cook at home and will probably do better work of it that these guys.\n\nThis brings me to Liverpool House. So loved and adored, even Anthony Bourdain gushes like a tingly teenage girl at a Justin Bieber concert over the chef at Liverpool House. But I have only one question about that.... WHY?\n\nThe restaurant looks pretty cool and homey, a place where you feel comfortable burning away the time, boozing and eating. There is no menu; the writing is on the wall... literally ON THE WALL. The quality of service is impeccable. The place as a whole is very welcoming, except for the noise, lotsa noise. Even if we removed the table next to us, populated by none other than Liberal MP Justin Trudeau, his lovely wife and his posse screaming and laughing like annoying 14 year olds at a McDonald's it would still be extremely noisy. But seriously this is about the food right? Yeah about that.\n\nThey have a decent menu considering the menu gets an once-over pretty regularly. As starters there was Oysters, Fried Pig Tails, Rabbit sausage and over course the ubiquitous Foie Gras plate. I had the Foie Gras of course. As a voracious Foie Gras eater, I can't resist the offering when it emerges. \n\nFoie Gras is a complicated love affair. It can make or break the whole experience, the better the execution, the further downhill the experience can go. And this was no exception. The chef basically re-invented the Egg McMuffin with Sausage using high end ingredients. I was offered a breakfast sammich made of some bread, firm and unyielding, some aged cheddar (me thinks) and Foie Gras... a big tasty, fatty, delicious pile of Foie Gras drizzled with Maple Syrup, topped with a perfectly fried egg. Cutting through it, releasing the egg yolk, mixing with the maple syrup, the fatty goodness of the foie gras... made for what was likely the greatest execution of a foie gras dish I have ever tasted. It was close-your-eyes-tilt-your-head-back-and-going-hmmmmmm good. And once done I gave up all decorum and fingered the remaining goo of yolk, maple syrup and fat off my plate. \n\nThen came the main. How the mighty have fallen. All the dishes ordered looked less than ordinary. The fish, the lobster spag, the ribs and even my plate of rabit and risotto. I find that rabbit is best served braised. To roast a bunny is to take many chances of it being dry... and dry it was. Dry enough for me to gulp down 4 glasses of water in a row. Was it good? Yeah but way freaking dry. I had to stop eating it. But that was just adding insult to injury. Let's talk risotto. The way I understand it, risotto is to be a creamy rich unctuous rice affair. The rice should be a starchy rice, a heavy rice, not a jasmine rice and oh did I mention creamy, rich and unctuous? This risotto was none of that. The frame of reference I'm talking here is Uncle Ben's precooked instant rice meals you get out of a plastic pouch which you nuke in the microwave. There were no ingredients that I could identify here that belonged in a risotto, I mean even the rice was wrong. I've never made a risotto myself but I bet I could have executed one with far greater success. The whole dish was an epic and massive failure.\n\nThe dessert, a sticky apple bread pudding thingie, was a thorough success in sugary goodness. But again, apples, maple syrup and some lemony sorbet... total win. But it was insufficient to buy back my good favors after the atrocious travesty of a risotto - an Italian would have screamed bloody murder and that dry choke-you preparation of the rabbit was unforgivable. This is especially egregious when a bistro like Via Crescent braises its bunny overnight in a ragout of carrots and celeries and sells it to you for half the price and yet never fails.", "I had a heavenly experience at Joe Beef a few months prior to coming to Liverpool House. I wanted to take my friends visiting from out of town to Joe Beef, but we couldn't manage a reservation, so I figured Liverpool House would do.\n\nWe got the horse tartar as an appetizer, and for mains, the scallops, rabbit and duck dishes (I don't remember their full names). I wanted to order the horse steak but they didn't have it that day. I had loved the horse tartar at Joe Beef, and I loved it too at Liverpool House. The scallops and duck were good, but the rabbit was a little meh. All three dishes had a good amount of delicious (but very heavy) sauce. No one brought us bread voluntarily but I asked for it and got it. Bread is a great vehicle for sauce. \n\nWhile the food was good (though not spectacular), my experience was tainted by the service and atmosphere. And despite waitstaff constantly walking around the restaurant, they weren't particularly attentive and it was hard to get service most of the time. But what was the most annoying was the volume. We were seated at the table closest to the kitchen, which is also next to the bar. First, the kitchen is loud. Second, one of the staff at the bar was drying or polishing a seemingly never ending supply of cutlery in a way that produced a lot of noise, of cutlery hitting each other. I can deal with loud chatter, but the sharp clanking of cutlery was really, really unpleasant and lasted for about 30-40 minutes.\n\nMaybe I had unrealistic expectations for this place by thinking it would match Joe Beef even in service, maybe things would have been better if I had been seated elsewhere. But I left disappointed, and with a hole in my wallet.", "First impressions of the decor is weird it reminded me of a sugar shack. All the menus are written on the wall in chalk.

This is something I haven't seen done before, and even though it's only a little thing, it makes a big difference to the experience.\n\nThe menu itself was interesting, and obviously changes regularly. We started with squid stuffed with lobster - it was good, but I wasn't blown away by it. The seafood here seems to be taken seriously, so I would recommend trying it when coming (I saw someone else eating the oyster plate, and had instant meal-envy). \n\nI had the ribs as my main, and they lived up to expectations - the meat was cooked spot-on, the sauce good and thick, and plenty of chips. I didn't expect to have such a meal at a 'gourmet' establishment, but I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nFor the dessert we had homemade doughnuts and a chocolate brownie. Both were really good (the doughnuts reminded me of Aussie doughnuts - lots of cinnamon), but I think the brownie was the winner.\n\nThe place itself is warm and cosy, and makes a great 'date venue.'

We waited and first sat about 10:30. The waitress took about 30 minutes before she came over and took very little time with us explaining the all in French blackboard menu. Once we decided on a few well known to me choices ( only because I read my fellow Yelpers reviews), we waited at least a half hour for our first course, fresh oysters. At one point about 15 minutes into the wait, I asked for bread as it was already close to 11 and we were starving. She finally brought over bread (actually tasty bread) and then the oysters followed 15 minutes later. So now it's well after 11, we have consumed a great deal of wine and the appetite is waning. The oysters were very delicious as was the horseradish sauce for topping.\n\nAnother 15 minutes, now 11:30 out comes the 4 appetizers. Mozzarella salad with bacon (actually a burrata and quite good) , a beet salad, a ricotta dish and a Bellini with gravlax with caviar. All were very good and were the type of dishes I was hoping for but would have enjoyed so much better at 10:15/10:30 when I wasn't drunk, tired and a bit annoyed.\n\nThe mains were the lobster spaghetti and the hanger steak. Both excellent tasting but as above its now almost midnight, I'm drunk from the  long wait, too much wine, no food and I'm first eating my dinner.\n\nSo now the host comes over who I admit was a very nice guy but I wish he would have checked on us an hour earlier.

Liverpool House has a rotating menu, so many reviews have mentioned specific dishes that were nowhere on the menu. However, I will mention what was on the menu yesterday when I snagged an awesome last-minute table. There is one main dining room and the bar area- totally decked out in Canadiana- deer antlers and row boat oars. Great artwook on the walls. We sat in front of the dinner menu and throughout people had to come stand near us to take a look at the options du jour.  This could be a great way to meet some new friends!\nService was great in french and english explaining all the wacky dishes and preparations. They also aren`t bad for the eyes...\nEntrees range from $9-20 and run the gamut from Huitres (oysters) to steak taco. I tried the gnocci, as I try to do at any place that serves this dish.  It was creamy and soft- obviously made within the day.  \nPlats (main dishes) run from $25-50 for the lobster spaghetti, which I saw and it has pretty much a whole lobster on top!  Most are in the $30 range. Of the fish options, artic char or dor\u00e9, I opted for the char with a `crust`of shrimp. Awe-inspiring and tasty. This had to be the biggest peice of char I have ever seen, and the smallest plate at my table.  The pintade (guinea fowl) was served on a platter and was the size of half a chicken. The rabbit could have served two, but my SO managed to finish it off!  No room for dessert, which is maybe why they only have 3 options. No matter, they all looked good. \nThe drink selection is great which wine by the glass and a whole other wall-sized chalk board to review the wines by the bottle.  \nAt the end of the meal, I stepped to the other side of the table to the hallway labeled, `pipi room`.

The lady who took our order was really really nice and very friendly. She asked if i wanted some potato salad and I just said yes! I mean you can't really mess up potato salad can you.

Mais bon, je suis all\u00e9 \u00e0 la z\u00abPresque-f\u00eate\u00bb de mon bon ami puis on a attendu un bon 20 minutes avant l'Arriv\u00e9e de tout notre monde. Je commen\u00e7ais \u00e0 avoir vraiment faim et \u00e0 m'impatienter un peu. Une fois la prise des commandes compl\u00e9t\u00e9es nous n'avons pas attendus longtemps. C'est un resto de 2 \u00e9tages et c'\u00e9tait remplit \u00e0 craqu\u00e9 (avec les party de bureaux c'est normal). Il y avait une client\u00e8le de 24-45 relativement bien habill\u00e9. \n\nEnfin, j'ai command\u00e9 la croquette aux crabes ( un crabcake) . Pas assez croustillant \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt mais une belle texture moelleuse au crabe \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur. Ensuite j'ai pris le confit de canard. Le plat principal vient avec une petite salade sans pr\u00e9tention . Le confit \u00e9tait bien. Les portions me portent \u00e0 croire qu'une entr\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 un bon repas complet. Juste le met principal c'est un peu mince voir petit. Les desserts sont pas mal  non plus. Pour moi cet endroit attire une client\u00e8le qui ne connaissent pas vraiment la bouffe ou plut\u00f4t un endroit \u00absafe\u00bb pour invit\u00e9 les gens difficiles. De plus, c'est une petite franchise qui attire une client\u00e8le apportez votre vin. C'est tr\u00e8s populaire pour une certaine client\u00e8le \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. C'est une bonne place pour un party corporatif ou party de bureau. C'est un endroit safe moyennement dispendieux dans le fond. Ahh oui, pis notre serveuse \u00e9tait vraiment mignonne en plus d'\u00eatre tr\u00e8s gentille. Ce n'est vraiment pas mauvaise, au contraire, c'est simplement que j'aime prendre un plus grand risque dans un nouveau resto que j'Essaye puis un steakhouse me laisse toujours un peu d\u00e9\u00e7u sur cet aspect.", "Good, not great.

We ordered the calamari and pate as appetizers. The calamari was really good and the pate was outstanding.\n\nFor my main entr\u00e9e, I ordered the filet mignon (with peppercorn sauce). The steak was a bit overdone.  I usually order medium or medium/well, but it was beyond well! It came with a side of string beans and obviously, the endless frites! I honestly wish the string beans could have been replaced with another vegetable.  The string beans were a bit bland and the fries were not crispy enough. Portion was sized perfectly.

Several of the other restaurants we were interested in were closed tonight.  Steak Fr\u00eetes is a small chain, about 16 restaurants mostly in Eastern Canada.  They have no liquor license apparently because patrons are encouraged to bring their own wine and there were many bottles of wine in evidence.  We drank water.\n\nThe restaurant is housed in a large room w/ high ceilings.  The wall on one side was red brick.  It's divided up into smaller spaces via a few very attractive room dividers made of wrought iron and plexiglass.  Light fixtures are suspended from metal racks which are in turn suspended from the ceiling.  We were greeted and seated at a table for two by one of the room dividers.  Chalkboard menus written in French are strategically posted around the room so they can be read from any vantage point.\n\nAs is usual in Montreal we were addressed in French by our server, Marc, who switched to English when we indicated that was the language we spoke.  He brought us menus in English.  We were interested in calamari as a starter, but wanted to know if there were tentacles.  There ensued a charades-like communication, which culminated in Marc wiggling his fingers to indicate that there were tentacles.  He was adorable.  In addition to the calamari we each ordered steak fr\u00eetes, which came w/ salad, sauteed vegetables and endless fr\u00eetes.  We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms.\n\nWe were brought a basket containing two very hot rolls w/ butter.  The rolls were very good.  The calamari arrived and it was among the best we've had.  The batter was crisp and flavorful and the calamari was meltingly tender.  The salads were simple, w/ butter lettuce, slices of red onion and dressing.  We were offered more rolls but declined.  The steaks arrived, both medium rare, mine more toward rare while Alan's was more toward medium.  The accompanying vegetables were tiny haricot verts w/ a couple of pear tomatoes.  The steaks were very tasty.  At Marc's suggestion we had a little sauce on the side, but the meat was so good the sauce was unnecessary.  The vegetables were very good.  The mushrooms were a pleasure  The fr\u00eetes were disappointing, lukewarm and not particularly interesting.  I was happy to skip them but Alan wanted them hot, so he asked for more that were fresher.  The fr\u00eetes server came around w/ his bowl and gave me more then started to walk away.  Alan called him back, indicating he wanted some too.  They were better than the first batch, but still not that good.  The rest of the meal overshadowed the disappointing fr\u00eetes and we were pleased."], "5": ["We made reservations for a Saturday night. Arrived on time and our table was pre set and ready for us. We ordered the calamari appetizer and flank steak main entree. The entree's are served with a dinner salad as well as a heaping of Crispy French fried and a seasonal vegetable.

We ordered 12 shots and the female bartender informed us that the bottle was only $145. It wasn't...she did not tell us it was $175 all in with tax. Fine. I could have forgiven this as a miscommunication, however when we went to pay for our bottle we did not leave a tip...because literally all the woman did was take the bottle off the shelf and hand it to us. Since we were planning on being there a while we planned on tipping in the usual manner if leaving a few bucks on the bar per drink. 5 minutes after paying the bartender came up to us and proceeded to lambast us, noting that the tip was not included in the  bill. She DEMANDED more  money...and continued to demand more money. Additionally, none of the other bartenders would pay any attention to us. I asked for a salt shaker for my tequila and one if them literally rolled their eyes. However, when groups of men came to the bar they were more than happy to shake their barely covered ta tas in an effort to squeeze a little more cash out if them.  12 girls, obviously unimpressed, apparently weren't worth the effort.

From that point going north until its intersection with Mont-Royal, you will find dozens upon dozens of venues where you can party in one of Canada's most famous streets.  Wood 35 is a fixture on this scene and as it empties out after last call you will see some of the highest concentration of attractive people you have seen anywhere.\n\nThat said, Wood 35 is full of beautiful people but, as you can imagine, it is pretentious. The music is good and the bartenders are hot, but you will pay a lot for drinks and it can get quite crammed inside.

It's been a few weeks so my memory's hazy (and they don't seem to have a website to refresh my memory) but I believe we had foie gras torchon and escargot for appetizers then duck breast and lamb leg confit for entree. The escargot appetizer was quite memorable, unlike any other preparations I've had, with creamy sauce and fresh vegetables or herbs. Great mix of texture and flavor. Highlight of the meal. The foie gras torchon was also excellent. The entrees were also very good, but perhaps not as memorable as the appetizers as I can't seem to recall much about them other than the fact that they were delicious! I had floating islands as dessert (good, but I prefer my meringue crunchy on the outside) and my husband had something that I have no recollection of other than the fact that it tasted very strongly of alcohol to me -- but then I don't drink at all and can taste alcohol in the most miniscule amount. He loved it and proclaimed it a very \"adult\" dessert. Overall a great meal, not sure if it's a destination-dining sort of place, but most definitely a solid neighborhood spot.

I said that plate was unacceptable. Yet another man came out and then advised that the plate could be replaced but would take 12 minutes (they had only 3 other guests that were already served / eating and 6 staffers?) or mom had the option to choose something else from the menu; an effort to dissuade her from choosing another plate.\n\nWhen I asked for bread the server looked down her nose and answered me in a condescending tone that I would be charged for it.

Tacos, burritos, Carlos and Pepes, 3 Amigos, that sort of stuff. \nBut authentic, regional hard-to-find Mexican dishes? Bring it on.\n\nYears ago I read an article in Air Canada's magazine \"enRoute\" while on a flight about a woman who was in search of \"Chiles en Nogada\" (Chillies in Walnut Sauce), a dish invented by Mexican nuns and involves soaking shelled walnuts in milk overnight in order to make them that much easier to peel, using those peeled walnuts and crushing them in order to make a heavenly sweet sauce (any skin left on the nuts and the sauce will come out sour) which is then poured over a roasted green poblano chile, which has been stuffed with \"picadillo\", a complicated mix of braised meat, candied barrel cactus and the shaggy Mexican cinnamon called canela. The whole thing is then sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. \n\nThe nuns made this dish to commemorate Mexico's day of independence, since the colours of the dish represent the colours of Mexico's flag (white sauce, green chile, red pomegranate) and it is usually served in the first two weeks of September in very few Mexican restaurants. It is a very rare dish to find outside of Mexico. You will never find this dish at Three Amigos or Carlos and Pepes because it is very complicated and involves painstaking work to prepare.\n\nEl Sabor De Mexico is in my hood and while I have walked by countless times since it opened 8 months ago, I yet had a reason to go in. Well, I walked by and I saw a special poster in their window, that they were serving chiles en nogada from Sept. 11- Sept 16 in celebration of Mexican independence. I knew I had to try it.\n\nReader, it was wonderful. \nI now understand why this dish is one of the Holy Grails of Mexican cuisine, all the flavours have to work together and not one should overpower the others. I could tell immediately the walnut sauce was authentic, I could see and taste the sweet ground walnut in a snow-white creamy sauce, the candied cactus and the nuts in the meat stuffing, the combination looks deceptively simple yet is astounding in taste.\nI then followed up with the coconut flan for dessert which came with a doll-like jug of an alcoholic-based sauce to pour over the flan. It was rich, creamy, decadent, not too sweet and hit the spot.\n\nThe servings weren't large at all, but this was another clue that everything was authentic. I find \"real\", authentic food is usually quite rich and fills you up because of the quality of the ingredients and I was quite full after the chiles en nogada and the flan. \n\nPrices are higher than usual but this is authentic Mexican, not Taco Bell.\nThe people here are really nice and friendly and now that I know how great the food here is, I'm not going to wait another 8 months before coming back.", "We were a group of 14.

Upon being seated, we were asked for drink orders. They do not have a cocktail menu, which is fine. But because of this, I decided I would have a good tequila. When I asked the waiter what tequilas they had, he responded 'Cuervo.' It was a big red flag that the waiter was unaware of what liquors they have at the bar. So I went to the bar and saw they also had Patron. But that's not great either, so I looked at the scotch. When I returned to my seat, I ordered a scotch, but then the wrong one was brought out.

One reason we chose the tasting menu was for the cheese course, but instead of bringing out the platter of Canadian cheeses (as for those who ordered a la carte) we got one slice of cheese filled with Parmesan-flaked whipped cream.  Instead of getting to taste their pastries for dessert, we got more cream--melting lavender ice cream, after the whipped-cream cheese, which had followed two other whipped-cream courses (with bits of cod, bits of corn). Despite tasting delicious, the courses seemed repetitive and it felt like they were stinting on any ingredient that cost money.\n\nThe restaurant is physically lovely, and there is talent in the kitchen,  but the tasting menu--like their hefty wine markups-- is a \"gouge-the-customer\" affair that should be avoided. I suggest ordering from the short but interesting regular menu if you want to enjoy this restaurant and feel that you got good value.", "Based on previous reviews and awards we were expecting more than what Toque actually offers.

They did not have focus, ingenuity, nor demonstrate exceptional skill that one would expect for a highly acclaimed restaurant.

We agreed that I would pick two restaurants and she would pick the other two.  Toque was one of my picks.  \n\nAs big fans of the tasting menu at Radius in Boston, we both decided to get the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing and Fois Grois addition.

I wanted a dry Hendricks Martini with cucumber, but they didn't have any Hendricks.  Upon further inspection of their bar, they didn't carry too many spirits.  This seemed to be a theme in Montreal; understandably, I think they focus more on wine than their US neighbors.\n\nThe wine choices were excellent and matched the food perfectly.\n\nThe duck and fois grois were very good, though I felt the portion of duck was far too small to represent the primary meat course.  \n\nUnfortunately, the other dishes were forgettable overall (you can see I actually can't remember two of them).  The portions did not match up against the price and the selections were just a bit too boring for me.  Everything was presented very well, but I think I needed at least one more meat course.  \n\nI should mention that my girlfriend was very pleased with dinner.  She particularly liked the tomato soup shooter, which was excellent, but once again suffered from being too small a course (Radius would give something away like this as a bonus).\n\nThe service was also only okay for a restaurant in this price range.  The wait staff was not very attentive, requiring you to chase them down for water refills or bill paying.  This might just be a culture issue though; other restaurants in Montreal seemed to follow suit.\n\nOverall I give Toque a 3 out of 5.

It was simple, it was evenly dressed, and it was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. I really wish I could talk about the other items I ate, but everything else has been overshadowed by that delicious, perfect salad. \n\nToque emphasizes creativity.

Sounds intriguing and guaranteed to be heavenly. I'd highly suggest getting the chef's 7 course tasting menu, as there will be even more creativity and suprises awaiting in each dish. In addition, Toque showcases their local suppliers. All of their food is locally grown/produced. \n\nYou'd think Toque comes with a hefty price tag, but it doesn't. The 7 course tasting menu (without wine pairings) comes in at $92 Canadian dollars, or $87 USD. Can you believe that? \n\nToque is definitely worth a trip to the lovely city of Montreal.

Perhaps that will change and become more charming as more people begin to fill the cavernous space that seemed rather empty the night we visited.\n\nThey don't yet have a liquor licence of any kind, so we couldn't have beer with our meal. The server said that was coming eventually, so I won't add or deduct any points in this review - it's just the way it goes for recently opened restaurants.\n\nService here was good, though I felt a bit like the owner was watching too closely. The question was not \"is everything ok?\" but instead \"what's the verdict?\" I got that feeling like when someone eagerly wants you to try something they made that they think is awesome, but that you know is really not that good.\n\nThe food: all of the dishes we had were simply OK, and some of them a little worse. Papadams had a very hard/stale and oily taste, which started the meal off on the wrong foot for me. The bhaji and pakora appetizers were sopping with oil and very heavy - which made me think perhaps the oil wasn't hot enough when they began frying? Anyhow, the bhaji in particular were very dense. There was also only one type of sauce which accompanied both dishes, where at other places there are a couple of different options.\n\nFor mains, my table shared lamb tikka masala, butter chicken, okra, and dal. Probably the okra was the most memorable, but only because I hadn't had okra cooked this way before. It was battered and fried with onions, spices and bits of paneer. Instead of being an okra curry, it's dry and oily, which made it not the best follow-up to the enormously oily round of appetizers. The dal seemed boring - tasted like beans, what more can I say? The lamb was cooked nicely in the tikka dish, but the sauce didn't have a lot of depth. No hot spice to speak of (maybe just because we didn't ask for it?) but also not a rich flavour from the other spices one hopes to find in the dish (and can find in Parc Ex). Butter chicken - very standard, which isn't bad, but because butter chicken is one of the more bland options one can order, it tastes better when served alongside dishes that are more exciting and spicy. The naan were enormous in size, but seemed one-dimensional, taste-wise.\n\nOverall, I would not rate the food here as bad, but also definitely not Parc Ex worthy.\n\nWhat makes this a two star and not a three star review is the price. Every dish seemed to cost a bit more than it should, and that really added up. We paid over $90 for a meal for four, not including the tip. In my experience, a similar meal at, say, Bombay Mahal would run $60 and be delicious. Fellow St Henri residents would be wise to put the money they save on food towards a metro ride: it will still be less expensive."], "4": ["Finally, there's a really solid and reasonably-priced Indian option in St-Henri. \n\nThe lunch buffet opens at noon on weekdays and is amazingly solid.

After 5pm thali plates are offered for $5.99. \n\nThe owner is extremely friendly and helpful. Triple B is a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood. It's definitely worth a trip.", "This was a good Indian restaurant reasonably priced.

Overall the plainness of the undressed scallops could've used a little boost of fleur de sel & pepper at the least.\n\nThe wine-poached egg with salad was a curious dish.  The egg, besides its color, wasn't remarkable.  It didn't take on a particularly interesting flavor from its bath in vinho tinto, but the salad nest around it was quite good in all respects.\n\nThe seared beef tartare on the other hand, was pretty damn spiffy.  The searing added a steak-like flavor to what I normally find a pretty plain-jane raw beef, texture-focused dish.  Marinated mushrooms tossed into the mix bumped up the umami quotient to tastebud teasing levels and the dense, crunchy crouton-like bits tossed in provided a texture contrast to the normal meat-mush-a-thon.\n\nThe desserts were both good. The chocolate cake / frothed, caramel brittle looked like an 8.8 on the Richter scale of dulce-de-cocoa upheaval (check out the photos).

Hubby had a miss, unfortunately- it was a game meat soup (?) with attractive curly pastas encased in a puff pastry. The flavors were very mild, but the soup was thin and had no actual game in it. The pastry was flaky, but when disassembled, would fall into the soup and make it soggy. :(\n4th course- we shared the lobster risotto which was made with the knuckles and surrounded by the tail and claws. Beautiful presentation- and it came with assorted colored carrots that were simply prepared, yet full of flavor- French country cooking at its best. \n5th course- by this time, I was stuffed! I had the fruit salad, which was a very original interpretation of your grandma's fruit salad. Cut into tiny pieces and topped with a frozen (I want to say) mango, but I can't be sure- maybe passion fruit? It slowly melted as you ate it and it was lovely. Also had a couple of very small broken meringue cookies interspersed throughout. Hubby had the chocolate cake with what I think was a raspberry sorbet. It also had a small dollop of a light white sauce, but honestly, I took a only small bite because I was going to explode.

I know, I'm a stupid American (I own up to it), but felt hungry throughout until the lobster (and then 2 bites and I was suddenly stuffed!) and was always trying not to eat all the bread between courses. My American style way of eating out expects to have one course after another which, when you think about it, is pretty gross.

This was an excepetion because it difficult to find Wagyu (or Kobe) beef in a retail butcher shop. The waiter informed me it was $15 an ounce and there was a 4 ounce minimum order. It was the best piece of steak I've ever had. For once I can actually say with a straight face, it was like butter.

The risotto was quite good as well but kind of overshadowed by the venison, which was like I said, incredible.\n\nThe entrees were good but not as good as the appetizers. The suckling pig comes with quite a bit of fat, so beware if that's not your thing. It was good, probably 7/10.

I was unsure how to classify the type of cuisine since the menu jumps around a little.  I suppose the majority of the menu is comfort food, but there is a good amount of influence from various Asian cuisines as well.  There is a good amount to choose from.\n\nWe were there with quite a large group (25 or so) for a friends birthday.  We were seated in one of the raised sections and had it mostly to ourselves, but it was not a private room by any means.  The decor is all new and nicely done.  Oro Toro is kid / baby friendly as well.  They brought a high chair and even though there was some crying, the restaurant was loud enough that we din't stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nWe started with an order of the calamari which is fried and served in a sweet chili Thai sauce.  The sauce was not bad, but quite sweet.  It was also all over the calamari which basically removed chance of it still being crispy.  The service was quite slow however, so it may have been crispy a few minutes earlier.  \n\nFor my main, I ordered the \"boeuf brais\u00e9\" and my wife had a spicy rice dish with shrimp.  There was a very long wait between courses, at least 25-30 minutes.  When our mains arrived, mine had obviously been under the heating lamp for quite some time.  The flavours were good, but the sauce on top had actually formed a small skin in from sitting too long.  My wife really enjoyed her spicy rice dish.  Both dishes felt slightly pre-prepared to me though.\n\nI don't think I'll be back for a romantic evening, but perhaps for another party of some kind or for a business lunch it would be appropriate.

I'd say there has to be something for everyone. For the appetizer I ordered the house-made  potato chips with the blue cheese sauce. After giving them a fair try, I did not like it and the *very nice* waiter offered me another appetizer! I was so impressed! So in replacement for that I took the Oro Toro Dip (goat cheese [there wasn't too much], cream cheese, peppers, mushrooms accompanied with tortilla chips and baguette bread). That time round it was good. \n\nNext was the main meal. I chose the Baked Atlantic Salmon with the choice of a side (I picked the house salad, which was great). The meal was awesome. Then as part of the coupon we had dessert. I picked the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie and my Hubby had the cheesecake. The cheesecake slice was surprisingly thin. Very thin... almost nothing to it - maybe because we were using a coupon and we paid less? I don't know.

Pretty to look at, but they weren't the best quality and some more fresh fruit on the plate would have been a nice thought. The Italian sausage was nice and comforting but it was topped with a dollop of mayonnaise. Clearly of the homemade variety but really unnecessary on a nice greasy sausage. My egg Benedict was perfectly cooked, warm, with a nice creamy glob of slightly under seasoned hollandaise. Oh and the potatoes we're perplexing in their simplicity. Also I'm always weary when there's no salt and pepper on the table. From personal experience in one of many restaurants, it's the sign of a chef with a little too much pride.

I still went ahead and order the scallops for entr\u00e9e and salmon pasta for main, scallops were really good I give them that, the salmon not so much, it was basically tasteless and as I say bathing in cream sauce.. Secondly, my husband's Tuna on eggplants was raw in the middle, call me unsophisticated but I don't think that's very appealing, maybe for a Tataki but for self-called \"Traditional Italian cuisine\" I don't think so. \n Also, it took ages to get our drinks and they ran out of wine and still gave me a half glass of wine, I would have rather have something else but anyways, they were very proactive in charging me for a 3/4 glass when I only got half of it. All that topped with a expensive bill to which they didn't even say Thank-you, when we paid...\nWe go to a lot of restaurants and travel a lot, and honestly I think people get easily fooled here in Montreal with all these pretentious, so-called authentic restaurant, that could easily be any average bistrot in Europe."], "3": ["Very tasty, portions very small and the menus is equally small.

The location is excellent being right on Saint Laurent just north of Sherbrooke but everything else left me feeling underwhelmed.\n\nI came here for a special event and since we were a large group we got a special deal which for $21 got each person an antipasto, choice of pizza and dessert.  To make things easier they asked that everyone pay cash beforehand and after tip and taxes it was $27.  Alcohol was not included in this.\n\nThe service was quite spotty.  I get that we were a fairly large group (20+ people) but a reservation had been made well in advance so they should have accounted for this.  Some people only received their pizzas after everyone else had finished theirs and my pizza was quite tepid when I received it.  It was also quite difficult to get the waiter's attention so that I could order wine.  Basically anyone who wanted wine had to flag down the server to when this is something they should have come around to ask if we wanted any.\n\nThe food itself was also kind of lacklustre.  The antipasto was a mix of items like bocconcini, melanzane (eggplant) and prosciutto and that was pretty good.  After that though the rest of the meal went downhill.  As I mentioned before my pizza was lukewarm at best when I received it.  Even if it had been served hot it wouldn't have been the greatest.  I had the Latina which came with rapini and sausage.  The rapini had no flavour to it and was very mushy so it was probably overcooked.  The cheese they used was of low quality and the crust was too dense and not cooked very well.  I'm of the opinion that the best pizzas are made in wood-burning ovens as it gives the crust a smokey flavour that can't be reproduced in an electric oven.  Dessert was a pastel de nata which was a little surprising considering it was supposed to be an Italian restaurant.  It tasted okay but certainly not one of the best that I have had."], "3": ["I stopped here for a couple drinks and appy, but after a couple drinks I ended up ordering a rib eye.  That's how it goes sometimes!  It was very good.  What I enjoyed even more, however, was the atmosphere of the restaurant.  We were out on the patio, Fringe Fest was on so there was a lot of action!  I'd like to go back and try it when things are a little more quiet.  Service was very good, very attentive.  I'd definitely go back, maybe actually order an appetizer...", "Have been in this restaurant only for brunch. The food and service are OK.

I visited Montreal in the last week of September and was ushered into the restaurant for dinner by Maurizio's cousin.  The restaurant was relatively empty and my first experience was that the beer taps weren't working so I had to stick with bottles.  Despite these warning signs we stayed, and am ever so glad that I did.  We ended up ordering a margharita pizza and penne in meat sauce - pretty standard items for an italian restaurant - and were more than a little surprised by the INCREDIBLE meat sauce, pizza dough, and general taste.  We have been to more than a few italian restaurants and, while I can't speak to authenticity or originality, these common dishes were certainly the best we had ever had.  I will be sure to make a stop here any time I am in Montreal.", "C'est par hasard que nous sommes allez manger chez Maurizio a 14h30, ce 1er janvier 2015 alors que beaucoup d'autres restaurants \u00e9taient ferm\u00e9s.\n\nL'endroit a l'air neuf, la d\u00e9coration est raffin\u00e9e, la musique conviviale, l'ambiance agr\u00e9able, l'accueil chaleureux. \n\nLa carte a juste ce qu'il faut pour laisser un choix satisfaisant \u00e0 tout le monde et les prix sont abordables.\n\nDes petits pains chauds nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 servi avec une petite assiette d'huile d'olive et de vinaigre balsamique pour saucer.

The eggplant (baigan bartha) needs to be less oily and much more piquant. The potatoes and cauliflower (aloo gobi) also could stand to have less oil and many more fresh herbs and spices (like turmeric, cumin and mustard seeds) as well as fresh ginger. Stale ingredients make for lacklustre food. The vegetable rice biryani lacked inspiration as well.\n\nFor North Indian food go to Durbar on St-Lau or Pushap on Mountain Sights or Thali on Ste-Cats.

The $9 plate is a heck of a lot of food - so much so that the plate is more like a metal platter, with generous dollops of curries, rice, naan, and vegetables.

They keep it simple, focusing just on tacos with a few drinks, with awesome choices for cuts of meat (e.g. beef tongue, sirloin, and flap steak) and other proteins, but in the execution of everything together, the taco at the end of the day fell a little bit flat for me, especially for $6 CAD/portion.\n\nIronically though, I have no complaints about the meat!  I had the beef tongue taco when I stopped by and they gave me a decent-sized portion that was soft, tender, and still juicy as if it just came out of a long-braise or pressure cooker. If I'm remembering it correctly, they also sprinkled some coarse sea salt on the top of it as well which really made the flavor of the meat come alive.  The problem unfortunately was on the bottom AND the top of the taco.  For some reason completely unknown to me, they put thinly-cut soggy fries on top of the meat, and then below, they layered it with TWO not-at-all-toasted corn tortillas.  Now two corn tortillas is not totally uncommon based on a few encounters I've had here and there, but for me it almost completely ruined the dining experience.\n\nThere's nothing worse than biting into far too much bread when trying to enjoy a protein.  Whether you're having a burger, a lobster roll, or even a taco, too many carbs surrounding the goodness within will downpour rain all over your day anyday.  As much as I was trying to enjoy the lime, salsa, and salted tongue, all of the flavors kept on being torn away by this awful chewy double-tortilla with soggy potatoes on top.  I eventually just removed the awful breadiness myself to try and enjoy the meat more, but at that point it was already too late.\n\nIf they just served the meat on a crisp tortilla with your standard taco accompaniments, I feel like they would be far more successful.  Unfortunately as it stands today, the entire dining experience is weighed down by an egregious amount of dough.

The restaurant is situated in the Old Port of Montreal, on a beautiful cobblestone street, tons of charm...that's where the positive part of this review ends.\n\nWe were greeted as we entered the restaurant and were seated quickly.  However, it took almost 20 minutes to get a glass of water, another 25 minutes to get our beer, which we ordered once our water was delivered.  When our extremely stressed, profusely sweating and almost invisible waiter did finally bring us our beer, in bottles, he asked us if we wanted a glass and if we did that we could go ahead and use our wine glasses, which we weren't using.\n\nAbout an hour after being seated, and 40 minutes after ordering our food, we still did not receive a morsel of food.  We noticed that the waiter had been bringing baskets of warm bread to the tables earlier, so I asked if it would be possible to get some bread while we waited for our food.  The waiter explained that 1) they were out of bread and were waiting for more to be delivered and 2) that even if they had bread that the oven was being used for something else and our bread would be cold.  He explained that we were \"first\" on his list for bread once they got more bread.  About 20 minutes later, he brought us bread...it was cold, along with the butter.  My friend decided to heat the butter by holding it over the candle flame, which could have worked brilliantly, only the plastic packaging began to melt, so cold butter is what we settled for.  \n\nSalad was included with my meal, but not my friend's, so he ordered a salad in addition to his meal.  The salads arrived about an hour after we placed our order (yes, AN HOUR FOR SALAD).  \n\nWe did finally receive our food, I had ordered the salmon with shrimp sauce and my friend had ordered the whitefish.  The portion sizes were large enough, but my salmon was extremely fatty and the shrimp had not been deveined, and my friend's fish was riddled with bones, we counted at least 30 of them.   Both dishes were served with rice and overcooked vegetables (rappini and zuchini).  We asked our waiter to bring us some lemon wedges, but he forgot, so we asked the hostess and she went to the bar and got us some (of course this was almost 15 minutes after we had been served the fish).\n\nThe waiter did not once ask us how our meals were, nor did he ask us if we wanted another drink after we finished our beer.  We had to flag down the hostess for everything.  \n\nI'd like to point out that the restaurant was by no means busy, and we were not alone in our assessment.  We watched a table of 7 people gulp down their green soup, and then wait for well over an hour before receiving their mains, and only half the table got their mains, the rest had to wait an additional 10 minutes.  \n\nOur meals (salad and fish) along with 3 beers total over $85.

The restaurant is on the small side, but has a great energetic vibe with a casual, warm decor and fab tunes in the background. What can I say? Both the food and service is amazing! The wait staff are very friendly and attentive, and our waitress made some great wine recommendations.  In terms of the food.... DEE-LICIOUS!  My date and I had:\n\n- Marinated vegetables (Red bell pepper, mushrooms and something else I can't remember. Very flavourful without being 'vinegary').\n\n- Polenta, taleggio and figs (Very good - you could really taste the figs, but the sweetness wasn't overpowering. The polenta had a lovely texture).\n\n- Lobster & fennel cannellonis (My favorite dish! I could eat this alone and feel quite content, lol.  The lobster filling is generous, and I think there are apples as well - I'm not 100% sure, but there is a slight crunchy sweetness that really meshed well with the lobster. To die for!).\n\n- Lasagna (Pork confit, pistachios and apple - simply amazing. This is one of their new dishes and it's not on their online menu so I can't provide the exact ingredients). \n\n- Pizzette (Bianca with fontina, potatoes and rosemary - not at all heavy as the potatoes are thinly sliced. The pizza dough reminds me of naan - delicious!).\n\n- Lamb meatballs (I'm generally not a fan of lamb or meat, but these meatballs were fabulous! Served in a light and tasty tomato sauce). \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu Bianco and the Lime Panacotta. My favorite was the tiramisu - the panacotta was nice, but I found it to be lacking in flavour.\n\nUPDATED: You must try to homemade porchetta! It's absolutely delicious and literally melts in your mouth. That's quite a compliment coming from me - I generally don't eat meat, like... EVER! =-)\n\n\nAll of the dishes are prepared with fresh ingredients and served in small portions that are meant to be shared. I really love this concept because it allows you to try different things, without filling up.  I think the only down side was that some of the dishes arrived at the same time, and by the time we got to them, they had cooled down a bit. Besides that, love this place!", "I absolutely loved this place. We dropped by on a Friday evening and they were full but invited us to come back in 30 minutes. When we did we were greeted warmly and promptly seated. The blonde woman who served as both a hostess and a server was so friendly and helpful, suggesting great dishes and even bringing over another staff member to give us advice on local jazz clubs. \nThe food was terrific, as well as the cocktails. The atmosphere is lively and festive. This seems like a place that would be overwhelmed with tourists just based on location, but really seemed like it attracted a fair amount of locals.\nHighly recommend!"]}}, "DkLvlCP1RvauIoT5tX6VMg": {"reviews": {"4": ["I had a quick lunch check here today -  really,  I just wanted a place to warm up and catch a bite - and it was absolutely delicious.

Long before it became a mainstream cultural phenomena.\nAt that time, Cafe Cine Express would host X-files viewings, so that people could come in and watch the latest episode at Friday midnight viewings.

Everyone silently eating really good cakes or pastries or drinking fresh coffee while watching episodes on alien abductions, conspiracy theories and cryptozoology on the giant screen in the back. Those were the days.\n\nSince those days, from what I understand the ownership has changed hands a few times, and it seems to get worse each time. The old character of the place is gone, it's usually filled with gamers or during World Cup soccer, sports fans going berserk.

We called to let them know that we were going to be late, and as a consequence were not only able to find parking right in front of the door, but have a choice of tables.\n\nAs Herve noted, the place is awesome in handling sound. Whoever the architect was, they definitely know how to make sound waves bounce around so you can hear you dinner companion, but not the other folk in the restaurant.\n\nThey have a tiny, but spectacular wine list. I imagine that it changes often. However I would not hesitate to order any wine that they offered. We had a Prosecco, a white Portugues Douro and a Spainsh white wine and all were delicious.\n\nAs for the food, it was delicious as well. (Given my  rating would you expect anything less?) I had the veal, she had the fish for our mains. I had the pate en croute and she had the leeks to start.\n\nI would guess that the menu for the food changes even more often then the wine list. Which in my book is a good thing, as it means that the chef (Julien Jor\u00e9) is probably deciding what to make, based on what tastes delicious, rather than what he can always get.\n\nSo unless you're reading this on the night that I wrote it, I would imagine that your choice of what to eat will be very different - hence my not going into any serious detail.\n\nWe shared a pistachio/grapefruit desert that was almost better than the savory dishes we ordered.\n\nIf I had any complaint (and I don't) it would be that our main courses were plated very similarly. Almost as if mom had wanted to dress both kids the same way, if you get my drift.\n\nI'd also suggest (nicely) that they might want to get a slightly larger selection of digestifs.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't comment on price, as I was treated. But given the reaction of my dining companion when presented with the bill, it wasn't outrageous. But it wasn't $10/person either.", "I had a brunch here. It was actually very good. Very tasty and very well presented. \n\nMy only concern was that the portion was small. But it was well prepared. \n\nI would be disappointed for them to close. As they don't seem to have so many  clients. The thing is for a brunch it is a bit pricy and people tend to just like the exact same things over and over again. \n\nLaurier East is more of a residential area. So perhaps the restaurant needs to adapt to what people around want ? Perhaps reduce the prices a bit or try to find a way to connect with the neighbourhood. \n\nThe decoration  is very simple and Scandinavian looking which is a plus. But adding some colour would be nice. It is all black and white for now. Make the place a little bit more cosy as we go there to eat :). \n\nI give five stars for the quality of the food and the quality of the coffee. Also the waiter was actually quite nice and helpful.

Amongst the brunch bustle of Petit Laurier is this one restaurant that doesn't seem to get much traffic, and I can't imagine why other than that it's that kind of situation where if you don't see anyone in there through the windows, you don't go in because god forbid you should be the only one in there. I went in because I was *not* feeling the over-crowded vibe of some of the other brunch stops, and guess what happened? My hangry partner and I sat in the sunny window seat, and when our meals were brought to the table, they looked so amazing and we looked so obviously excited and content all at the same time, that people walking past took one peek through the window and began to flood in through the front door. \n\nThe magical waffles, arranged in a waffle sculpture with white chocolate balls and a passion fruit cream, were so perfect that NO syrup was required. They were moist, just the right sweetness and beautiful to eat. My eggs benedict with smoked salmon was equally artfully done, brought out in double like twin treats on a big plate. The eggs were exactly as they should be, plus I had a side of thin, crispy toast perfect for dipping into the yolks. I'm pretty sure the English muffins were made in-house - they were cornmeal and sweet, and I scarfed them down like a hound. It was almost a shame to rip into such a beautifully presented meal. \n\nOH, before I forget to mention, the coffee: they have no regular drip coffee, so shucks, you're just going to have to settle for a perfect espresso-based cup. They had no soy milk or other milk alternative, so heads up if you watch lactose intake. I didn't mind. Our server was nice about it, in a kind of tough-luck-but-this-is-how-we-do-it unapologetic kind of way - I can respect that! I think the chef here takes a great deal of pride in the restaurant's offerings. \n\nSo, I say, don't be shy: get your brunch butt in here for a sit down.

The melon was ripe and tasty and worked well with the salty proscuitto but I didn't understand why it was served on a bed of mixed salad. The salad was completely unseasoned (not even a drizzle of olive oil), making it dry and pretty tasteless. Also the starter was served in a bowl making it quite difficult to eat since the melon and prosciutto needed to be cut (they were served in slices). My main was on the same level and pretty good. I ordered the linguine al vongole and was a bit surprised to see that the clams had been blended into the tomato sauce rather than served whole on top of the pasta as is customary.

It was $200 for two but I left hungry and very disappointed."], "2": ["The most memorable thing about this restaurant is its interior design, which is apparently one of the best in Montreal. \n\nThe charcuterie was average and the wine was decent, the main course wasn't satisfying either. All in all it was not a great experience.", "While the waterfront atmosphere is nice and the service is very attentive, this restaurant is very overpriced and the menu is tiny. I went here because of a great review in my travel guide. If this restaurant had posted its menu on its website, I would not have gone. The food here is fine, but in a city with no shortage of great restaurants, why limit yourself to a tiny menu and subject yourself to high prices?"], "3": ["It was a good foodie experience, but I remained underwhelmed. The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing, the design is top... however, there were little things here and there that interfered with the food experience and left unsatisfied. It all started with a 30 minute conversation with either maitre d' or sommelier - I could not really understand what his role was. The first 3 or 4 our choices of wine were sold out - and after each bottle the sommelier tried to say - well, it is the middle of the week, you should understand that we are low on our stock - when in fact it was Thursday. Thirty minutes later we settled on our wine - which turned out to be Canadian, merlot-cab-temp mix... very nicely bodied wine with a lot of complexity - so if you feel hesitant about ordering Canadian red - don't be. Then we were told that the tasting menu was done for the day. Ok. As a nice gesture they served us an amuse-bouche. The first course we ordered was quite nice and tasty. My second course was also very interesting. My boyfriend got a cast iron rabbit, which would have been delicious, but for a very strong smoky flavour. We both agreed that it killed the tenderness and delicacy of the rabbit meat. The service overall was good, except for the sommelier/ maitre d' leaving mid-night, without even stopping by our table to say goodbye - we pored the wine ourselves for the rest of the evening. Overall good experience, but the restaurant may need some time to fully develop."], "4": ["If you are a fan of all things offal, as I am, then this is the place for you. Came here for lunch because I couldnt squeeze it in for dinner. They have a more limited menu for lunch, but I started with an amazing spicy lamb tartare with mint and some sort of cheese..all went together so perfectly and harmoniously. My entree was a bit of a let down..it was pig heart and pig liver...liver in any animal has that distinct irony taste, unless its foie, and the heart was too chewy for my liking. It is what it is...not knocking the chef..it was my chioce for ordering it. Dessert was chocolate and pig blood panna cotta...now that kicked some serious rear end. Just enough blood to add even more richness to the chocolate..very creative dessert..loved it. I gave it 4 stars because even though I wasnt crazy about my entree- my app and dessert were great and I would like to go back for dinner whe they have a lot more to offer.", "Our host in Montreal had made a reservation for 14 of us after a work-related event.  Truth be told, we're scientists, so of course he chose a restaurant called \"DNA\".  I did my research on yelp and, to be honest, was a little worried about how this evening was going to go because:  1) I wasn't in the mood for offal, and 2) it sounded like the service could be hit or miss.\n\nBottom line:  the night at DNA was a total gastronomic success.  We all left satisfied.\n\nFirst let me say they dealt with our group (we weren't ornery, but we were big) really well, taking orders efficiently, always topping off glasses, and there were no serving mistakes made.  The wines were excellent, and we all especially remarked about the Canadian whites.\n\nTo start I had a green salad, but this was no ordinary green salad.  It had delicious little sour berries with it, just the right amount of dressing, and finely chopped vegetables to round out the very flavorful mixed greens.  If that's the house salad, I thought, we're in for a treat.\n\nFor my main course I had fish, nicely crisped on the outside but still moist inside, with butternut squash caponata.  My dining companions had butternut risotto (which had that lovely consistency that Italian restaurants strive for, where it spreads on the plate) and goat leg with peach marmalade.  Everyone literally cleaned their plates.\n\nFor dessert I had apple crisp with vanilla ice cream.  The ice cream didn't melt too fast against the warm crisp, which was more like cobbler and such a pleasant, homey finish to the meal.  The topping was just the right amount of sweet and I loved being able to see the vanilla bean's seeds in the ice cream.\n\nMy half-complaints:  the waitress described the goat as \"baby goat\", which made me a big sad; and the men's bathroom apparently played commentary from an old well-known hockey game between the Canadiens and the Oilers, but no such entertainment in the women's room.  Note to DNA:  women like hockey too!  On the interesting side, the bar's TVs were playing the movie Sideways.", "A beautiful location in Old Montreal overlooking the river and Habitat 67. Very good service. Tasty food. I can't put my finger on why, but I rate this at 4 stars, not 5. I'm glad I went but perhaps all the hype is over the top. Still, a great meal."], "5": ["Me and my wife have been to DNA a good 5-6 times now, with most of the times being full tasting menus. We've also brought about 16 different people with us over the course of the last year, so we've heard a lot of feedback from other people as well.\n\nIn short: A place bursting with potential and creativity that sometimes misses the really high marks it can achieve. \n\nThere have been times where Derek and his kitchen have blown us away with their dishes and others where we were left wondering where the genius had went. The first 3 tasting menus we had at DNA left us amazed each time with each dish being as great as the next one. We thought it even rivaled or bested some highly regarded 5-star restaurants we've been to (like Joel Robuchon or Alex). We also thought it would be our \"go to\" place in Montreal for the next years as well. Our experiences there were just that great.\n\nIn the following months we returned to DNA a handful more times and it wasn't as great. Some highs and some misses here and there, not typical of what we had experienced before. One night we brought 10 montreal food bloggers with us to review the food, and I don't think anyone was really impressed. Chef Derek wasn't there that night, so perhaps that was the issue. \n\nSpeaking of Chef Derek, a really friendly guy and definitely passionate about his ingredients and where they come from. Really flexible and loves to accommodate diners, even vegetarians ones like myself. If you tell him in advance he'll prepare you a full-on tasting menu that will not feel like he just pasted mushrooms or cheese on to replace the meat.\n\nService has always been a high point at DNA, and has never really felt below their high standards. Prices have seemed to get higher for the tasting menus (our first few times we got about 8-10 dishes for $85 and now they offer 5 for the same price? I am not 100% sure on this)\n\nSo while DNA remains our favorite restaurant in Montreal, we dearly hope they can remain consistent in the quality and creativity of their dishes. We say dearly because DNA is close to our hearts (and stomachs) and we hope to be able to enjoy Derek's amazing talent for a long time more.\n\nWe're going back on Tuesday for a tasting menu, along with 3 other people.. I guess we'll see :)\n\n-----------------------\n\nedit: So tonight we had 5 tasting menus and it was a real success and the best meal we've had at DNA. In fact, Derek was so on fire tonight that he managed to make me eat beef for the first time in 13 years, because everyone was so ecstatic at how good his ribeye steak was. My fiancee said it was \"the best piece of meat I've ever had\", which says a lot. And yes, it was worth breaking a self-imposed ban on red meat that I have kept intact since I was 17...\n\nPretty much every dish was exceptional from the ingredients, presentation and technique... and the service was outstanding (Thanks Gwyneth :). A real tour de force and all 5 of us were extremely happy.\n\nWell done, DNA, well done. It's good to have you back.", "So after I had finished my meal we found out that they change their menu once a week!!\nThis was by far one of the best \"Italian\" meals I've had this year.\nEverything I've had from amuse bouche to the dessert was outstanding.\nGreat ambiance and a very attentive staff.\n Highly recommend this restaurant!", "I ate at DNA as part of a weekend birthday celebration. We had a fantastic meal! I would recommend DNA to any of my friends who were visiting Montreal. Food was fresh, innovative and outstanding. Our waitress was super friendly. After we asked where DNA purchased the cappuccino mugs that we were drinking from, she returned with the brand of the mug and the address store in Montreal where they were sold.\nThe meal was expensive, about $250 for 2 people with drinks, but that is what I expected.\nRestaurant is a bit hard to find for an English speaking tourist, as there are two \"D'Youville\" streets next to each other. Place D'Youville and Marguerite D' Youville St. DNA is on the street closest to the water."]}}, "z2nZ6iM8v8jr_BUERdiLWA": {"reviews": {"1": ["We returned from a day out sight seeing and I decided to look for some inexpensive ($$ or $$$) french food.  I saw this one, with the 4.5 stars and that it was right across the street from our hotel (Marriott) and thought it was a good choice. \n\nAs others have stated, there is only one entree.  Your only choice is whether  you want soup or not and we ordered it.  We also ordered some house wine and were served bread and butter with it.  The bread was good and so was the wine - what I'd expect for the price.\n \nThe carrot soup was ok.  It was a bit bland but not bad;  That was the highlight of the meal!  The 'salad' was iceberg lettuce, walnuts (right out of the bag) and a bland vinaigrette dressing that was very acidic.  They could have at least toasted the walnuts if not glaze them and it wouldn't take much effort to improve the looks and flavor of the salad by adding a bit of arugula or other mix.\n\n  The main course, was of coarse, the steak and fries.  The steak was very low grade, tough and not a lot of flavor.  The sauce helped a bit.  The fries were fine for what they were.\n\nThe price is $26.95 per plate which is way too much for the quality of the food served.\n\nService was ok, not bad but nothing special either.\n\nWhen we go out to eat, the biggest factor about whether we like it or not is the food.  The food here is way below average and the price is way too much for what it is.", "Please read this before you go. This might save you from a bad experience.\n\nWe read the reviews on yelp and came here. We were surprised to see the limited items on the menu. And we thought that with only a steak to make, it must be masterfully done.\n\nFour of us entered and were greeted by the only lady who wasn't in uniform. The place had a nice vintage, faded glory vibe. We sat down at a table in front of the bar and waited for about 5 minutes before we got our water. The lady who served us, in fact everyone in the resto, looked like they were working in the army: no smile, angry-looking, albeit self-efficient and prompt. We were intimidated to even ask for anything and felt like eating in training camp. It was very awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nThe steak was disappointing (and that's the only thing they make too). We ordered the steak medium rare and medium, but all the meat was tough even to the knife. We doubted the quality of the meat was acceptable. The carrot soup was nice and refreshing, however. Fries were crispy and the bread was fluffy. The dessert tasted like something you'd find at a college dining hall.\n\nIt was a scar to our trip to Montreal. We trusted yelp and went but the service was horrible, and the only table d'h\u00f4te offered was subpar, even for the price. We argued that we could have gotten nicer steaks at Chili's in the United States for the same price.", "I read the earlier review about how terrible the food is, and I have to say they got it right. If they do only one thing, you think they could get it right. The fries were from the freezer and the steak smothered in sauce. The salad was miserable and the profiteroles were with ice cream, not whipped cream, which I think is miserable. There is good food to be had in Montreal, but not here."], "2": ["I must say, this is an interesting concept in a restaurant. The menu is exceedingly simple: Soup of the day, salad with nuts, loin steak + frites, desert. I will hand it to the owner as coming up with a wining formula to make money in a restaurant. \n\nThe soup was a tomato-vegetable soup which was thin and did not have any real body. I would expect a more rich soup. Salad was simple lettuce with walnuts and an oil dressing. The salad was too oily and the dressing was lacking flavor. The main course was, again, solid food - but did not impress me with the bistro flavor I was expecting. The loin steak is not the most flavorful cut. The frites were average tasting and would have been better if they were fresher. Dessert was two bollocks on a plate (ice cream balls covered with pastry and covered with chocolate). The pastry was stale, so I just fished out the ice cream. \n\nOverall a decent concept, but with essentially one soup, one salad, one main and one desert on the menu I would expect them all to be excellent and flavorful. This did not live up to my expectations.", "I'm always on the lookout for a good steak. American style, Brazilian, Argentinean, you name it. The French are known for their Steak & Frite. I heard of this Entrecote Saint-Jean a few weeks ago and figured I'd give it a shot. \n\nNow. If your menu has only ONE item and your restaurant is jam packed like it was tonight, shouldn't the grub just blow me away? I think so.\n\nWhile the restaurant is a thing of an age gone by beauty, the food isn't. \n\nIt's simple. You get soup, salad, steak & frite and desert... let's go through them, because when I want to crush something I do it step by step.\n\nLeek Soup. Not half bad, piping hot, but severely lacking in the seasoning department. \n\nSalad. The lettuce hadn't gone bad but some leaves were definitely damaged. The dressing was so so and very rare, as in barely a teaspoon of it for the whole salad.\n\nThe Steak & Frite. Now this is where I get bitchy. Firstly if you promise me match-stick fries, don't bring me frozen McDonald's like French fries. Secondly the steak... This is a French restaurant. The French who invented everything about cooking worth a damn, should know something simple, some very rudimentary about steak preparation. Once you take it off the heat YOU HAVE TO LET IT REST. It's the only thing on their fucking menu and they fuck it up. My plate was a bloody mess, completely screwing up the sauce. They have ONE thing on the menu and they haven't mastered it. What a shame.\n\nDesert was the saving grace. Profiteroles, delicious and refreshing. But I doubt I'll be going back. When I don't finish a 6 oz steak, there's something wrong with this world.\n\nThe service was good, but never were we asked about how are meal was going, if it was any good.

One of the more regretful meals I have had in Montreal.  Strange because a few years ago I recall a review that sang the praises of \"L'entrecote.  I do not understand why.  Previous reviewer said that soup was hot and lightly seasoned.  Confirmed - soup is, well, just soup and scaldingly hot.  Previous reviewer said that salad was bizarre.  Confirmed - Boston lettuce with nondescript dressing and fresh walnuts on top.  At least they weren't rancid which is commonly the case.  Previous reviewer commented that steak was badly cooked.  Actually steak was cooked to my specifications but the frites and the 'special' sauce on the meat were unremarkable.  Previous reviewer talked about how dessert was good at very least.  Disagree.

My wife's baked eggs with hollondaise and smoked salmon (the Financial Times) were only slightly better. And the service? Coffee arrived about 20 minutes after we sat down, and a good five minutes after our food. Getting the staff's attention to ask for water refills was next to impossible -- a situation made worse by the over-salted food. \n\nThe evening menu consists of a half-dozen traditional bistro dishes.

The next thing I did was search the place and found out it was really near my job. So of course I had to try it.\n\nWhen I got there, I felt like it looked a lot like the Momofuku noodle bar in New York and I was anticipating great things. I ordered fried calamari, the ramen burger and had a chocolate tarte for dessert. The fried calamari was different from other places, but it's not one of my favorites. And now the ramen burger. Visually stunning, but the taste left me hanging. Texture with the noodles was great, but I would have liked it a bit spicier and found it a little blunt. Luckily, I had a leftover of chipotle mayo from the fries and added it to the burger, which made it a bit better. The burger isn't the best, but it's worth trying. For dessert, I had a chocolate tarte, which they served with almond chantilly and dulce de leche. It was ok. My brother had a lava cake, which was served with black bean ice cream. Interesting combination, and surprising taste.\n\nI went back a few times to try out all their menu, and I find it interesting that they often change desserts, which are written on boards on the walls. Make sure to read all of them, some are interesting picks, such as salmon tartar tacos. Also, probably one of the best fried chicken in town. They also have a filipino menu, but I never tried it.\n\nOne interesting thing about this place is the drinks. I had an amaretto sour, and the ice came in shaped like litchis, which I found cute.\n\nOne big negative point for me is their service. The staff is very small, ans when the restaurant is in a rush, getting food can take a while. Weirdly, the place can be packed with a line-up, or empty. Maybe it's because of the location (near metro plamondon). Also, make sure you reserve before you go. I once went during their opening hours, but the restaurant was closed. \n\nOverall, the food is great for the price, and it's a great place to try out for cuisine that sticks out of the ordinary."], "4": ["This place is a must try restaurant that is worth the travel to an area that most would never even think to bother going for dinner.

I tried the Bourbon Lemonade but it seemed quite watered down. It could have been more tangy.", "Wow Meat lovers this is the place for you.  \n\nI had a Groupon for this place, which I like because the restaurants usually have some sort of tasting menu, and boy did  they.  If memory serves me right we had pork stuffed fried egg rolls, sweet spicy chicken wings, pork kebabs, another pork pepper dish, rice, chicken in Adobo, and a pork & Potato curry or sorts.... Oh and don't for get desert, it was a crispy banana desert.\n\nThis spot is a definite repeat as there were alot of interesting items still on the menu that I'd love to try next time.  The menu seemed to have some really spicy items on it as well, so to my fellow chilli heads this could be a interesting spot to try out."], "5": ["Finally an amazing Pinoy restaurant to call our own!!!\n\nwe came here on a cold december saturday night, and literally ordered half the menu, it helps that we were four :)\n\nI've had many Filipino friends over the years and whenever I ask them about Filipino restos they all seem to back track and give some sort of excuse why there isn't any... y'all liers, I've seen them all over the place in San Diego, San Fran and LA :P thrppp\n\nI read somewhere that they serve ramen burger here, yeah the new fad of the moment... don't order it, it's over rated, the ramen patties are too filling, and it really doesn't jive well with the meat patty, I don't get it, actually it's down right gross. I think all ramen burgers are gross not just this one.\n\nBut the rest of the stuff we ordered was amazing!!!\n\nwe had fried chicken wings, pork ribs, sisig, chicken and pulled pork tacos, pork steamed bun, and some rice dish i forgot the name...\n\nThe fried chicken wings are the best I've had in a while, they are fried and then caramelized in fish sauce. The fish sauce is very mild you don't smell it but it gives it a nice salty finish and makes it yummy wow!!!\n\nNext, the tacos, the chicken were fried a la KFC minus the bones, it had pickled carrots and daicon radish, it was so good. It was the same with the pulled pork. The taste is well balanced with sweet salty and tangy.\n\nThe pork bun was good, it had hoisin sauce, anything with hoisin is good. The bun was fresh and soft, but with all the other dishes we had, this one was lost in the mix.\n\nThe ribs were amazing, caramelized with sweet soy sauce, served on a bed of garlic mash potatoes. It went very well together. The ribs were tender a little on the sweet side but the mash counter very well with that. The sauce was so amazing I kept on putting it on my rice :)\n\nThe sisig is a hot sizzling plate of pork, and they crack an egg on it and mix it in. The eggy taste didn't really add anything to it I thought. It was a bit salty even with the egg, but it is served with white rice so that was fine.\n\nMy amazing find of the night was a rice dish, it was called Bicol express. It had coconut milk and shrimp paste in it. The rice came in a large bowl with some pork meat and long beans, on top is a spoon with hot sauce and shrimp paste that you mix in. Now shrimp paste is an acquired taste, but I love it. Overall I thought it was a bit toned down, I think it could use a bit more shrimp paste, it was too mild for me it needed more salt. The marriage of coconut milk and shrimp paste is heaven. It was delicious and fragrant, I've never had it before and I loved it. I think this was the most Philippine dish of the night aside from  sisig. next time i will ask for more shrimp paste though.\n\nIt was a great experience, for those of you who want to try something new this place is definitely a good find. Even though it's on victoria near Van Horne (metro plamondon), the place looks very trendy and clean not like the neighborhood wink wink. I think we are sorely lacking in Philippine cuisine and this is a gem. They have been opened only 7-8 months, and the place is not that packed yet, so go before you have to line up out the door!!!\n\nPrice wise it was about 25$ each with tons of food and a drink each, it could have been less if we hadn't ordered the 14$ ramen burger... It's sooo cheap for food this good :)\n\nSalamat ;)", "This place is awesome!\n\nFirst, the food is excellent. The bucket of chicken is the best fried chicken I've had (admittedly, I'm not a connoisseur) and is an amazing value. There were 15+ pieces for $25. The steamed buns were great as well.\n\nSecond, the cocktails are very good *and* are an excellent value. Where do you find $6 cocktails?\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and helpful. I plan to return soon!", "This place is tucked away in a not-glamorous neighborhood. But we live on Victoria so we thought we'd try it. Score. The fried calamari was definitely up there with the best we've had, and it's a favorite we eat often. We also had the Adobo (chicken) and the Lechon (a pork dish) both with rice.

Also their regular sushi menu has salmon roe sushi which is amazing. I don't think the Friday/Saturday special menu is quite worth it. There are some clever sushi rolls on there but nothing will amaze you. You can get the same ingredients in different rolls. \n\nIn all of these restaurants the service is sometimes lacking. I think it's understandable considering the type of service required. The night I was there they appeared to be understaffed. I had to wait a few times to get someones attention to order or to pay at the end. Starting around 6:30pm, there was a line beginning at the door. I'm not sure if they overbooked their reservations or this was due to being understaffed. I definitely felt bad for people waiting for us to leave while I waiting almost 30 minutes to pay. Although I didn't mind because I wasn't in a rush and I'm a lot happier they didn't try to kick us out (like some other places).\n\nDefinitely worth the money. I would recommend booking reservations for an early dinner (6:00pm) or prepare to wait at the door.", "I mainly go there for sashimi at lunch for 15 bucks.

My sister got the duck entree which had 'OK' sauce, but literally, where was the duck?! Very small portions.  I ordered the fish special on the board.  No flavor whatsoever.  It was so disappointing. I NEVER add salt to my food, and that's all I was doing every single time a plate came out.  For dessert we had the cheesecake - which was NOT cheesecake.  It was some sort of whipped cream in the shape of a slice of cheesecake.  By this time, my sister and I had to crack of laughing because what else could we have suspected at this point.  The beer was good.  I would ONLY recommend the beer.  Everything else was overpriced and had no taste.

Upon entering the restaurant it was odd as it took awhile for us finally to be acknowledged by anyone and then once we were actually seated we picked up on the odd vibe. As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no music and the overall feel of the dining space is awkward as all conversations can be heard. There were numerous moments where a noticeable silence took over and I felt I could hear the people next to me chewing (or maybe I was just that hungry)!\n\nService: AWFUL!!!

Although another waiter passed by our table a few times and even cleaned the nearby table no one seemed to notice or care that we were left totally abandoned.  We figured we'd give it another 5-10 minutes before we gave up, but could not even spot our waitress during that time. \n\nFood: While I see other reviews describe the food as \"disappointing\" I cannot even comment on the bread because after waiting for nearly one hour we did not even see a simple bread basket! We finally reached the point where we just walked out and left since the waiters were all MIA and from what we could see from the one table that had food next to us, it did not look to be worth an hour wait. \n\nNeeds overall improvement!", "The fish special I ordered tonight tasted like boiled water and it had the consistency of a microwaved dinner. It was served on a uninspired bed of overcooked red cabbage and frozen cubed carrots.

For about $40 per person everyone got an appetizer, salad/soup, entree and dessert. The menu was completely in French, but the waiter was able to translate very well what our options were. It was really tasty food, although my appetizer was pretty intense. I started with a goat cheese appetizer, a salad with a main course of scallops and dessert was an inverted apple pie with vanilla ice cream with coffee.\n\nThe appetizer was really tasty, but it was an awful lot of goat cheese for one person. I probably could have stopped eating after that, there was just too much cheese. The salad was nice, not amazing, but good after the appetizer. The scallops however, were delicious! They were piping hot and came with rice and green beans. The dessert was supper yummy and went well with the coffee they served.\n\nI'd probably order the escargot next time I go, everyone seems to rave about it.

None of the stereotypical French pretentiousness and complexity either.\n\nEven an uninitiated eater will have no trouble understanding the menu and seeing how, with main courses so well priced, he can afford a starter.\n\nMy goodness is that a good idea. Finally a portion of Escargots comme-il-faut. No cheese on top, just snail-ey goodness and garlic. Restrain yourselves or you'll eat the serving plate together with your escargots so delicious they are. \n\nThe poached salmon is simplicity made dinner. Just a skilfully cut slab of fish, with a delicate cream sauce and a purple cabbage garnish that complements the salmon perfectly. Delicate tastes mingling together, begging to be savored at length. \n\nThe stew was, on the other hand, a symphony of strong flavors in the sauce and the earthiness of root vegetables competing to please the lucky eater. It was absolutely delicious.\n\nWhat do you mean, it comes with dessert? You must be kidding me. It's old Montreal after all, where business is business and tourists are scared. No sir, we're totally serious.  \n\nTheir dessert selection is wider than their menu suggests. For us they had a citrus cake, a cheesecake and baked apple. Everything was delicious, but the cheesecake was my favorite.\n\nSkip the expensive wine list and go for the house wine.

Certainly a steal for fine dining, especially after having lived in places like SF or DC!  On top of that, we each received a complimentary cup of French onion soup.\n\nTogether, we ordered the escargot, rabbit pate, duck leg and smoked salmon.  The escargot was warm and buttery and just melted in our mouths.  The pate was kind of like cold meatloaf - I myself am not a huge fan of pate, but when in Rome...why not?  I ordered the duck leg for myself and the portion was great, as it came with squash and potatoes!  My fiance ordered the smoked salmon - and he says it was the best smoked salmon he's ever had!  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the apple pie and coconut cake.  I would loved to have creme brulee or another typical French dessert, but they were not part of the deals.\n\nThe sauvignon blanc I had was crisp and subtle, meanwhile my fiance's cabernet was mild and went very well with the food!\n\nThis was probably one of the best meals I've ever had!

OH MY GOOD GOD it was heaven wrapped in cream sauce and baked with cheese.  I asked to add mushrooms to the crepe and they came on the side.  At first I thought, that's weird, but it was nice to have a mushroom with every bite.   \n\nMy husband opted for the Crepe aux Avocats, which boasted pesto, avocados, and tomatoes. He added swiss cheese, which was also baked on top.  It was a refreshing and yummy crepe but nothing compared to the fatty, rich, creamy crepe that I ordered.  He was jealous.  My reasoning for 4 of 5 stars instead of a full 5 is that the asparagus was just slightly tough.   \n\nA senior tour sat next to us and cracked me up with their Seinfeld's parentsesque comments.

My husband had Le Jamaicaine, which was similar, but without strawberries. Both of us easily finished our crepes and one of the two scoops of ice cream, were satisfied and agreed that there was no way we could have had a savory crepe and then the sweet ones, so I think it's the type of place we'd return for a dessert or specifically for savory ones for a meal.

So good in fact that it went to their heads and its been downhill ever since. \n\nI've eaten at some rather fantastic French restaurants in Paris, Lyon, Beaune and throughout the South of France in my life, not to mention restaurants in many of the other great cities of the world. None of them had the arrogance in their manner of service and treatment of clients that this place had. I've seen it a few times before to a lesser degree at those pretend French restaurants (the type where the waiters speak with a French accent, but actually can't speak French -- happened to me in Beverly Hills, California) where they try to bluff their way through, and on rare occasion at restaurants that had once been great and had lost it and were left simply to trade on their former reputation. \n\nI noticed it the first time we tried to eat at Bonaparte and they sent us away because the kitchen had just closed. Its not that I don't understand the kitchen being closed and thus the inability for them to serve us, but rather it's the manner in which it was done. \n\nI noticed it the second time on the amazed face of our concierge when she tried to make a dinner reservation. She was astonished at how they treated her, the concierge of one of Old Montreal's top hotels. \n\nAnd we experienced it in such full force when we arrived for dinner that we had to leave, never having ordered. It was just such an unwelcoming dismissive arrogance that comes from the restaurant staff thinking the customer is not a customer but a mark who should count himself lucky to be in their presence, totally forgetting that actually they are there to welcome, serve, and make us, the customer, feel special. \n\nThe crowning moment was when the waitress told us how we should not speak French because if we did she would then answer in French and we of course could not understand French. Quelle surprise, given that my family is French and I speak fluent French having lived and gone to school in France, and my wife speaks more than passable French. It just blew us away and was the final straw that popped the bubble of high hopes for dinner at Bonaparte. \n\nThe sad truth is the motto of this restaurant has become \"Bonaparte, where the customer is always wrong.\"", "Fancy but boring food. Nothing innovative or new. I ordered the filet minon and asked for medium rare and they served me a well done gray piece of meat. The server offered to take it back, but then my wife's food would have gotten cold while I was waiting for a new plate. For $40 piece of meat, I expect it to be cooked properly the first time.

After she took our orders, she disappeared completely. Even though my wife mentioned that we would like some wine with our main courses, she did not even bothered for once to stop by and ask if we like our food or if we need anything. She was running around like maniac without stopping. I guess she just did not like us. This restaurant serves souffles. Is does require 18 minutes of wait and in our humble experience, in restaurants that do serve souffle, waiters tell about it, so people can preorder instead of waiting, especially with two tired children. So no souffle for us. No questions about after dinner drinks.

And it was perfectly cooked to the medium rare that I like too! \n\nAnd it is a good thing that the steak was so incredible, because the seafood linguini I got as my first dish was just okay. It was supposed to be in this saffron sauce but I think they must have forgotten the saffron, because it didn't taste like much and that is such a strong flavor normally! But at least the seafood itself in the pasta was pretty tasty. \n\nAnd the chocolate mouse....Wow. I love chocolate.

I can appreciate the stress they were under and know that it is not easy to deal with that, but it would have been nice to be checked on a little more and explained what was happening while we were sitting in almost pitched darkness. The manager brought over a candle and even mentioned the fact that it was our honeymoon, but never offered anything to help with the fact that our dinner was cut short and we were left sitting in an un-air conditioned building in 80 degree weather.

Despite it being duck foie gras, it still tasted great and I enjoyed every bit.  My wife had the lobster salad, which also tasted great.  The lobster was cooked to perfection.\n\nFor the entrees, I had the lobster stew which I admittedly also devoured completely.  Perhaps I was hungrier than usual that evening, but the lobster was again cooked to perfection.  There was also a lot of lobster.

Like the creme brulee, I used morsels of bread to clean the plate.\n\nMy wife had the sauteed scallops with truffle oil and mushrooms.

The decor is very nice and very cozy and warm.\n\nTheir menu is amazing. Of course I picked the quenelle since it's so hard to find. The table d'h\u00f4te came with some amuse gueules that consisted of bites of cr\u00eape souffl\u00e9e, with a rillette and a spoonful of diced marinated veggies, lettuce and mackarel. It was very yummy! For the apetizer, we had a small salad with the real typical salad dressing they serve in France, made of olive oil and dijon mustard with vegetable ravioles made of pickeled beets and other root veggies with goat and blue cheese. And for the entr\u00e9e, obviously, I had the quenelle made from pike with veggies and a homemade potato croquette. The meal was absolutely delicious.\n\nThey also have a 5 \u00e0 7 special where you can just drop in, sit at the bar, have a sip of their private imported wine while eating a plate of various cheeses or other bites.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant to anybody who wants to experience a typical meal from Lyon without having to travel across the Atlantic.\n\nI was charmed and will definitely go back with my family and friends."]}}, "ZulmdtfskW1cwCBnRn-nFw": {"reviews": {"1": ["We didn't mind the Tyvek across the street, it was a holiday weekend, so there was no construction noise, and the place looked quite inviting, the weather outside was pretty good, so we sat outside. I had read a lot of positive things about Le Mas Des Olivers, especially on YELP, which is most cases reliable. However, though the restaurant was beautiful, and waiters very charming, personally, I felt the food was sub-par. I know, I know, why did we order the predictable onion soup? Because both my boyfriend and I adore it, but the onion soup had to be the worst on the planet, It tasted as if the chef had fallen asleep with a box of salt in his hand. I was sick for two days from the amount of salt, and I was too sheepish to let them know. My fault. Boyfriend, who never complains about anything (God bless his soul), whispered to me during the repast that he felt the soup was a bit too salty! A Bit??? Canned anchovies have less salt in them!! We then moved onto the main course. I had a steak, he had the surf and turf. My steak was good, well seasoned, tasty, with nice steamed veggie, and a really great small salad, I could not complain, however.... Boyfriend's steak was the size of a dime, and the lobster tail was awful! What could be worse than an extremely overcooked, dried out and glued to the shell lobster tail? (Yes, the onion soup!!!)  And please do not order an iced tea.... it was scary, foamy (?) and bitter. Dessert was not so bad as all the rest. The Mille Feuille tasted very homemade, pastry crispy and delicious with fresh fruit and a beautiful and sensuous cream. The chocolate mousse was very good as well, piped into a cocktail glass, with a rich strong chocolate topping. Go there for dessert, because dessert won't cost you $180, which included only 1 small inexpensive glass of wine, and an ice tea (if you want to call it that). Who would think that you could have a bad meal in Montreal? I certainly did not! Oh yeah, and by the way, right next door to Le Mas Des Oliviers was a West Indian place that was packed to the rafters. A strong and steady crowd moved in and out, some carrying take out bags, others not. Next time I go to Montreal to see my boyfriend, we are headed there, for sure, instead!"], "2": ["I had the escargot and the lamb dish.  Nothing special.  Everything was covered with a brown sauce.  I didn't even know that there were veggies under the meat and sauce until I got midway through my meal.  The sauce made the entire dish taste the same.  The escargot - nothing special.  I've had better in many other restaurants.  The dessert was good - Napoleon cake and profiterol, although the profiterols are not the real ones like they serve in France.  Will not be coming back."], "3": ["This place is fine. Food is very French, very delicate. However, if you don't want to ruin your night at this place, make sure that you won't order the foie gras. It's terrible. It tastes like crappy ice cream...", "Very average. I used to go to this place often about 12 years ago and the food was phenomenal, as these years progressed, the quality and service decreased, so we stopped going. After many years, we decided to try it again. To our dismay, it was just OK. The Cesar salad, was intense, way to much garlic and minimal flavors. The steak au poivre was fine, but for $40, you would expect a bit better than fine. Some others at our table had the veal chop with a mushroom-cognac sauce, which was just borderline,. Honestly, the sauce you could have mistake for a package.  The atmosphere is still the same, nice and traditional French, but with this goes the attitude and stiffness of the waiters.", "The service was amazing. We stopped in based on the hotels recommendation and it wasn't too bad. For starters, they have a complimentary bit of bread, smoked meat, carrots (weird?), and olives.\n\nWe skipped on appetizers and ordered a bottle of the house wine for the table and went straight for the main course. I ordered the stag steak, which wasn't anything special by itself. The sauce didn't really give or take anything from the flavor. By cutting up the onion and eating it together with the steak was when it really came to lfe. The stag could've used some more marinade or additional flavoring for the sauce."], "4": ["Really good restaurant. Meat was perfectly done. Very friendly staff offering great service. \nExcellent deserts as well.", "I can't believe I've probably walked by this place millions of times but never tried it until about a week ago.  It doesn't look like much from the street but inside a truly fantastic food experience awaits you.  The decor is cosy and the service is top notch.  Their focus is on French food and they do that well.\n\nWhen you sit down they bring you a plate of chorizo sausage, olives and carrots.   While the sausage is tasty don't fill up here because there is lots more to come!  To start we split a platter that included confit de canard, grilled shrimps, grilled mushrooms and fried calamari.  The calamari in particular were very well done.  They were crispy and cooked just right.  To add to that I ordered the duck in green peppercorn sauce.  The duck was well done and fell apart.  The sauce was a pleasant addition.  You could really taste the peppercorns and it was salted just right.  They also brought some fries to the table to be shared by everyone and those were quite good.\n\nI finished off the night with a chocolate lava cake.  This is one of my desserts so my expectations are always high when I order it.  Fortunately this one lived up to those expectations.  It was piping hot and they succeeded in leaving the interior uncooked.\n\nPortions are huge so come hungry or be prepared to share with your dining companions.

The service is very professional without being standoffish and the table d'hote is long and varied with many choices and very good value. We were 4 and all ordered from this menu.  To start there is a choice of soup (the absolutely best clam chowder I have ever tasted.....strange in a traditional french resto), snails of the day mmmmmmmmmmmmm and a wonderful salad with olives, cherry tomatoes and cashews.  This salad must have been 'local' because each component was delicious be itself but as a salad was wonderful.\nWe had 4 different mains and of course we all sampled each.  The veal chop was perfect, nothing more to say.  The rabbit was very good. The dish I ordered was two types of beef, a small filet and braised short ribs accompanied by mashed potatoes that were delicious. The filet was cooked perfectly and very good but the braised short ribs were, well TO DIE FOR! My friend ordered a plate of 4 different meats, duck, beef, lamb and fois gras.  She could not speak, she was moaning as she was eating! You really must have the frites so we ordered some for the table and they were also perfect.\nThere really wasn't room for dessert...but we 'suffered' through.  The napoleon was flaky light and delicious layered with whipped cream and fresh berries and the chocolate mousse was equally delish.\nOn the owners suggestion, we ordered  a bottle of the house red as it was from an area of France where we enjoy the wine and we were not disappointed\nThere is a reason that Le Mas endures and that is the reason we keep going back.

One of the owners introduced himself (Aniello), and throughout the evening made sure that all was well.\n\nThe decor is simple but classy. I love the idea of the bar, where you can quite happily wait for your table. We had an 8pm reservation but they weren't ready for us till at least 8.15.

Just sayin'.\n\nOnce we were seated, the most delicious nutty, fruity olive oil and crusty bread were put on the table for nibbling while we perused the menu. I had the polpetti (baby octopus) in a yummy tomato sauce as an appetizer (I expected it to be cold but it was hot, tender, and nicely balanced with tomato and basil). My partner had a simple, very, very fresh Boston lettuce salad dressed with lemon, oil and grated parmesan. Our friends had the parpadelle with the lamb (I think) rag\u00f9, and the melanzane parmigiana, both of which were delicious, non greasy, and well balanced.\n\nFor mains, I and one of our friends had the braised shoulder of lamb. I love lamb for its strong taste and fatty bits. I was pleased to see they had kept the fatty bits, and it literally fell of the bone. The portion size was substantial too. My partner had the swordfish, which was delicious and had a surprising mix of flavours and textures: the chewiness of the accompanying Italian couscous, and the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes and sultanas it had been cooked with. Our other friend had the spezzatino dell'Hostaria, which was a veal and vegetable stew. I often find veal a bit bland (I like lamb, remember), but this dish had an amazing flavour that made me want to have it myself next time.\n\nI did wish there had been more accompanying vegetables. My meat came with a token potato and broccolini/rapini stalk. The staff even asked us if we wanted an accompanying salad, which we took.\n\nI was quite sure I couldn't eat any more but the basil sorbet sounded like it might help my digestion, so I pushed my indulgence a little further, and am very glad I did. It was delicious!! I had two (very short) espressos to round it all off. With our three glasses of prosecco and a bottle of wine (sorry, can't remember what it was, but it was recommended and was a lovely medium red that went well with everything), the bill came to $345, which I consider to be a very reasonable price for such an excellent meal. Also, it was very late by the time we left (getting on for midnight), which means we ate at a very European, leisurely pace. Since the experience is as much a part of the pleasure as the food, this puts Hostaria way up there for me. I'll be back!", "Hostaria definitely stands out from most of the Italian restaurants I've ever been to.  The restaurant is simple yet chic and classy. We were welcomed immediately with a nice appreciative welcome.  Service was spectacular. I don't think I've ever been tended to as much as I was at Hostaria.  The owner even introduced himself to us and kept on asking how the food/service was throughout the night.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, they gave us complimentary bread, which I could have eaten all by myself. We started by ordering the Polipetti alla Luciana (Baby wild octopus with tomato and capers).  The octopus was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes and capers added just the right touch. \n\nFor my main entr\u00e9e, I ordered the risotto of the day with homemade sausage, which was delicious. The risotto was hearty without it being too heavy.  And the homemade sausage was divine.  Portion size was good: nothing too big, but definitely enough to keep you satisfied.\n\nHostaria definitely made my trip to Montreal a whole lot better and wouldn't hesitate on going back!", "Very authentic Italian food. Ate here while visiting Montreal for my birthday dinner with my husband.  Great experience and great food!

From always having eyes on our drinks to being more than helpful deciding on a meal.  \n\nWine:  Beautiful wine cellar located mid restaurant with a nice selection available in many prices, and the staff new there stuff offering parings specific to each plate.\n\nAnd always my favorite part to review, the food:\n\nLet me start by having you think about any bison/buffalo you may have had in the past.  Slightly gamey, wholesome and earthy, but somewhere just off of beef.  Well wipe your slate and grab a friend.  The bison steak for two here is one of the greatest cuts of meat I have ever had the pleasure of being haunted by.  If I could go a week without thinking about this steak... It really is something.  The outside is crisped like a perfectly cooked duck skin, with beautiful caramelized  thin ribbons of fat.  Buffalo is rather lean, but the little that was here more than did the trick.  The inside was exactly how every piece of red meat I ever order from here on out better be.  From the sear leaving a shallow ring of brown on the outside fading quickly to a Bordeaux-esque perfectly rare center this was the super bowl of meat.  My wife suggested we go with this.  I was set on the gnocchi (which one of our dear friends ordered, and let me tell you it is a 10/10 dish as well) but the steak could not have been a better pick.  So lets recap:  perfect sear, perfect rare, perfect tender, perfect caramel.  I am saddened only at the fact that I am in sincere doubt of ever finding another slice of red meat to ever compare to this.  I think need to go pray...", "Why were we the only table at this place? Actually there were two others. Unbelievable authentic Italian.  From the deep fried artichoke appetizer to the mozzarella and tomato salad to my pasta (some very salty fish like anchovy shaved over deliciously-tossed garlicky and olive-oily pasta) to this dessert which was a tart filled with Nutella, I was swooning. Also had the most unusual port. Heavy aroma of spice but not overly so. We were with a native Italian who spoke in their language with the waitstaff and he raved about how good it was. Go!

The warm potato salad with marinated octopus was out of this world. It was bursting with flavor and was more octopus than potato salad in the end. The goat cheese starter was also very nice, though quite rich. For entrees, we had the lobster ravioli and the fish & chips. The ravioli was fine, but nothing special. I didn't care for the presentation or the mass of onions in the dish. The fish was nicely done and melted in your mouth. Dessert was a brownie with chocolate ice cream and some sort of raspberry sauce. This was the worst part of the meal and it really lacked a deep chocolate flavor. \n\nThe service: This is where the whole experiences goes a bit awry. We're seated promptly by a stiff maitre d' and then wait for 20 minutes for anyone to come take a drink order or tell us about the specials. Finally the maitre d' comes over and says something off-putting like, \"Looks like you're anxious to order\" and takes our orders without telling us the specials. The food comes promptly and was true to the menu. We receive no other service until halfway through our entrees I finally flag down a waiter to order another drink. Apparently, he was our waiter but this was the first time he spoke to us, as he was busy flirting with other patrons. One of the drinks was delayed until our entrees were nearly completed. For dessert, he reeled off a long list instead of giving us a menu. Only during dessert were we ever asked how the food was. The waiter was jovial but he was not good at his job service wise.  \n\nThis is hard to rate because the food was overall very good but the rest of the experience I would never want to re-live.  Average.", "Very brisk for Christmas lunch. I strongly recommend reservations. It is very humourous that they would turn us away when the place was empty when we walked in (see picture). But clearly a popular place and by the time we left every table in the place was full. \n\nWithout a reservation in busy Christmas lunch season I would recommend a reservation for anything more than 2 people. We sat at the bar.\n\nExpensive lunch:\n$10 soup\nLunch special $19 soup and pasta\n\nFood was ok.... one of my colleagues had to send the lunch special back and the meat was raw. To their their credit they did check shortly after the first bite and were quick to bring a new plate out.\n\nI have great respect for restaurants that have staff that can recognize a problem quickly. I think this was reflected in the tip.", "Pretty good place.  I would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could.  Busy atmosphere.   I had the salmon tartare with french fries and was pleased with the meal, but not blown away.  Not overly expensive, but I would not consider this place to be a good deal."], "4": ["Went here on a Thursday  night after walking past a lot of the restaurants along the port street.  Holder was much bigger, busier, and had more life that many of the places (and was slightly recommended).  My experience was a little bit mixed.  They are obviously quite busy, so you aren't going to get the most personalized service here.  The food is solid and everyone is running around busy, and the place has a bustle about it.  \n\nI had the buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad which was excellent.  The main course, a \"stew\" dish was a little boring, but filling at least.  Our desserts were pretty good.  Nothing over-the-top impressive.  Wasn't blown away or anything, but its a good place to go to be around a lot of people in a big open and modern warm space.", "This was my second visit to Holder, but my first review.  The temp outside was a wonderful 18 degrees as we strolled from our hotel to the restaurant only a block up the street (thank goodness).  The dining room was warm and inviting as we hung our parkas in the coat room.  There is a good variety of banket, center table and bar seating.  There are wonderful copper accents in the room and the lighting is an interesting pattern of iridescent glass and metal. \n\nMy choices from the menu were simple and rustic which fit my desire for comfort food due to the cold weather.   I started with a Grey Goose dirty martini, and my normal 3 olives...the olives were not the usual gigantor ones served locally here in NOVA, these were quite petite and as I bit into my first one off the skewer I realized it was not pitted!  I don't mind, but it helps to know ahead...and let's face it spitting those out in your hand isn't too graceful in public.  But the bartender did my drink justice...dry and oh so dirty, and the glass was full...yummm.\n\nMy starter was a vegetable soup with a great beefy tomato broth as the base, nice touch of sage in the background, salted and peppered to perfection.  The veggies were rough chopped including scallions, zucchini, chunks of tomato, petite lima beans and julienne mushrooms. The steaming bowl was topped with fresh shaved parmesean.\n\nMain course consisted of beef cheeks (no, not the ones you sit on silly) bourguignon style.  This is classic French cooking...this method slowly simmers the beef in wine which tenderizes cuts of meat that would have been too tough to cook any other way.  The flavor of carrots, garlic and onions came shining through in the wonderful sauce that draped over the mashed potatoes like a velvet sheath.  Simply paired with the beef and mashers were haricovert....green beans folks!  I tried to figure out if the chef had actually used a burgundy, as the rich sauce could have been done with a good cabernet instead.\n\nAll in all the meal was everything I wanted that evening and since I'm headed to Montreal on a regular basis I will probably go again.  The nice thing here is that the staff instantly recognizes us Americans and quickly opts out your French menu for one in English....Merci!", "Excellent French food for my first visit to Montreal!"], "5": ["This place ranks highly on our list of great dining experiences for my boyfriend and I. We came here on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately next to the window. The restaurant is spacious and beautiful. The server was excellent and he was very helpful. We began our meals with two amazing appetizers. Both the foie gras with gingerbread and beef tar-tare were out of this world GOOD! It was culinary bliss and we haven't even reached our entrees yet. For the main course, we ordered the halibut (not on the menu, but was on the chalkboard) as well as the pappardelle with mushrooms. They were so delicious - it makes my mouth water just describing it.  We also had coffee at the end of our meal and the final tab was surprisingly low for what we thought we were going to pay.  Overall, Holders is a great place to enjoy what Montreal has to offer.", "Such a shame Yelp does not have Canadian presence yet... I'm sure the locals have lots to say about this gem amidst their city.\n\nKnock. My. Socks. Off.  That is what Holders did to me.\n\nI started with a roast vegetable gazpacho topped with goat cheese- heaven!  (Although my sister found it too similar to salsa)\n\nNext up was lobster ravioli with a truffle oil sauce while my sister had her usual steak-frites.\n\nA bottle of Brouilly and we walked out the door with a bill under $100!  \n\nHow fantastic to be able to eat in such luxury without paying too much money!", "Had lunch here yesterday and was really impressed.\n\nAtmosphere: Really warm and welcoming...with slight illusions of grandeur without going nuts. Essentially, my kind of place!\n\nFood: Everything on the menu looked amazing...so I decided to order based on, what I like to call, food window shopping.  Aka...I'll have what that guy's having.  I went with the daily soup to start - a tasty carrot and sweet potato bisque, then had the grilled salmon for main. That salmon was made to perfection...one of the best I'd ever had...the word scrumptious comes to mind.  And the mashed potatoes and the citrusy butter drizzle was delish as well.\n\nService: We were seated promptly and out waiter was super attentive...he even took the time to explain each special in French and English - which I said wasn't necessary but he said he didn't mind since it would help me (since I can only catch every other word or so). It was a very busy lunch hour but he also took the time to come back and check on us more than I would've expected given the number of people there.\n\nVerdict: Would definitely come back again!"]}}, "ZWiiPpKOHC-DHRd2D6D1gw": {"reviews": {"1": ["Was looking so forward to eat there since my son enjoys it and the revue.

I ordered the 10 piece chicken, Mac and cheese, and the coleslaw. Because it was take out only, I was told it was about a 20 minute wait. I asked for the picnic basket so I could take it across the street and eat with my 3 children. 45 minutes later (!!!!) I ditched the picnic basket idea and went straight home. I now had big expectations for this much talked about fried chicken.  The big chunky pieces of chicken were fatty and undercooked. Unbelievable! The Mac and cheese lacked pep, and the coleslaw was actually the only saving grace of the whole meal and that's not great given my kids didn't get past the fatty chicken. Neither did I. It was frankly just gross. I really really really wanted to like this place as the people were friendly and the atmosphere lively.  Will keep looking for the best fried chicken because it's definitely not at this place.", "Went tonight and was pretty disappointed. I had the brisket sandwich and my friend had the fried chicken. We shared the creamy coleslaw and the sweet potato side. The brisket was really fatty and hard to bite through. The sauce and the bun were good though. The fried chicken was not crispy, pretty soggy. The creamy coleslaw was delicious. There were 4 sweet potato pieces, and the 2 smaller ones were good. However, the 2 larger pieces were pretty undercooked and not really edible. Sauce that went with them was good. Had the lemonade, that was good too. It was nice having a picnic, but for 41$, it wasn't worth it and I don't plan on going back. Blackstrap BBQ in Verdun, imo, is much better.", "I was really excited to try this place but so disappointed once I did. Worst mac and cheese I had in a while. Chicken was very so-so.

This is primarily a takeout restaurant, there are a few seats inside and a couple outside.  A vacant restaurant next door is being renovated to become a more permanent seating area later this year.  On really nice days, ask to borrow a picnic basket and take your munchies to the neighboring park.\n\nOn my last visit, I ordered two \"meat and threes\" plates:  one with fried chicken, one with pulled pork.  There was enough food for two meals each.  It was well packed in plastic containers, and was still warm even after a 40-minute trip home.  The chicken coating was unpleasantly soft; the pulled pork had not much sauce, and not too much flavor.  However I was disappointed with most of the sides:  soft fragile hush pupppies, extra-salty burnt cornbread, leathery sweet potatoes.  I didn't order any sauce, because it was extra -- on reflection, maybe a sauce would have livened things up a bit.\n\nWhile I waited, the staff were very friendly and chatty.  The owner talked about the renovation plans for next door, the lack of air conditioning, and the possible locations for a second branch.  It was fun to watch the ginger beer and other drinks being made to order, shaken with ice in Mason jars.\n\nI'd like to try a couple of other things on the menu, including their drinks.

The salt was ok but it didn't taste anything other than that. I'd suggest adding more spices in the batter.\n\nHushpuppies well... it's fried cornbread.

That tasted grease over grease.\n\nSame with fried sweet potatoes, the sauce was overwhelmingly greasy and tasteless in general.\n\nThe pinto beans... tasted the best in my meal., but nothing out of this world.\n\nI'm still rating this a 3 star though, mainly because it's one of the only places in Montreal that serves southern comfort food.", "The concept is very cool. You get a basket of food and then you go picnic in the adjacent park.

The chicken was already cold and hard when I opened the basket (3 minutes after receiving the basket). At 14$ (+tax +tip) the Mac and Cheese contained some really cheap cheese that I found didn't smell right. The pulled pork was just fine.\n\nNow, maybe this is all just one instance of bad experience and/or maybe I don't like the southern food.

The gravy was a little spicy, which was nice. The hush puppies were good too. Not a fan of the collard greens, the black eyed peas or even their ginger beer.

My friend let me try the mole sauce and it was extraordinary- a nice little kick and completely homemade. \n\nThe owner also brought a special spicy sauce to our table. It was super duper killer spicy, but also delicious and homemade! At some point the owner came out with pork tacos and gave them to us on the house!

The restaurant is located on pedestrian-only rue Prince Arthur and is fairly new. The space inside is small but very charming. I was there on a summer evening but I imagine it would be a cozy spot for a dinner in winter. I dined outside and was able to enjoy the music of a live street performer which was nice. I had the chicken quesadilla and it was great. Tortilla was delicate and the filling delicious. Price was very reasonable, especially compared to the many other restaurants on that strip, and service was friendly and good.

They offered us free drinks but no comp to the meal. My husband had to negotiate that even though it was clearly an error on their part. I had been back twice since then and the food was good.

It is my fav thing on the menu to order so i know what its supposed to taste like. When i sent it back to the kitchen they had the nerve to send it back to me saying if they remake it, it will taste the same! I was shocked! The waitress was apologetic but the damage was done.

He brought two coffees, instead of one, and we say:\" it's ok, we will keep it.\" \nThe server then walked away. We then realize that the \"coffee\" is more like dirty dishwasher, only one long teaspoon was given for the coffees and there was dried, caked on red velvet cake encrusted on the teaspoon. The cream had also curdled. Our server was no where to be found. We managed to flag down another server and at this point we would have left had we not been with our 78 year old aunt who was hungry.\nWe explained the situation to the other server and she said (no apology or anything):\" Let me get another coffee.\" So she just drops it off with no other word said.\nWhen we finally get our food, it's decent and nothing to write home about.

It was just a plate of rice with a small portion of chicken. There was no spice, it came with no vegies, and not enough sauce to moisten the rice. We would not order it again.\n \nThe Sesame Chicken was quite good. The chicken had nice flavour, and the plate includes broccoli, peppers, and onions; which gives the meal much more body than the previous dish. I would have this again.\n \nThe Mongolian Beef was ok.

Both dishes tasted very good. We cleaned our plates. Comments about prices being expensive are, in my opinion, somewhat misplaced when you consider that the dishes come with rice (normally sold separately elsewhere for $2.50-$3.50). So while I know many more authentic Chinese restaurants where you can get great dishes (with rice) for $12-$13, paying $14-$15 for just a dinner main (n/i rice) doesn't shock me. \n\nFor dessert, 3 mini desserts hit the spot.\n\nAll in all, a good experience.

This was especially unforgivable when they had a small table available in the back of the dining room!\n\nNonetheless I stayed for the food. The price was decent, but the food didn't make up for the neglecting service. The cauliflower curry soup was watery and had so much curry flavor it completely overshadowed the \"cauliflower\", if there was any. The broiled fish was cooked well, but lacked seasoning. So I guess the kitchen made up for that by making the sauce extra salty. The risotto it came with tasted only like chicken broth. To add insult to injury, the food looked like it sat under the warming lamp too long: a skin had formed on the sauce and the mashed sweet potatoes had a dried surface. Dessert (cinnamon & rum creme brulee and rhubarb sorbet with baked meringue) was decent. The only thing good was my server, who took the time to introduce my dishes when they came out.\n\nWhile the price was great, the food was only so-so, and the service at the host stand completely turned me off.

The selection of main dishes always includes one vegetarian option (and my vegetarian friends always seem to enjoy it), and a variety of fish, seafood and meat dishes. Their cuisine is rich, with purees and sauces adding a lot of flavor, and unusual grains and vegetables filling out the plate.

They have some nice combos and a huge place to eat-in if you so desire, but I must admit I'd rather forget the frills and just have a bigger cone. \n\nService is slow - the custom cooking machine only goes so fast - but the real downer is just the pool of oil that forms midway through the cheesier cones.

I found it nigh impossible to take a bite out of it, and keep your mouth on the cone to prevent the toppings from spilling out without dunking your nose into hot cheese or meat. Any significant bite from the cone also will send toppings spilling out of the side of the cone you're not eating from. So... the way I could see them improving this pizza cone.... is by not putting it in a cone at all... Maybe cut into it and lay it flat like a normal slice of pizza? 5-6$ for a novelty cone of pizza is also a bit steep. The soups looked interesting enough that I'd go back and give them a try.

I ordered the Carni Kono for myself and a Tacchino - smoked turkey - Kono for my bf. I had a choice of several side salads, a regular green salad, couscous salad, bean salad and crudities. I went with a bean salad and pesto pasta salad. I loved the choice of drinks, diet coke, San Pellegrino, very little limitation, in fact, the only limit was that I couldn't choose the Odwalla. \n\nI had a nice talk with Ted, who eagerly told me about their groupon for today (1/2 price on Kones) and told me more about this mysterious cone I was about to indulge in.

What spilled out wasn't just tomato sauce, it was chunks of bacon and pepperoni, it was cheesy, and I was pleased!\n\nThe salads were both good, in my opinion the bean salad was great because the salad dressing was on the side and so I could adjust the acidity to my taste preference.

It was made of parsley, cherry tomatoes (nice and ripe! not like those giant white centred things claiming to be tomatoes that you often see :P), red onion, cucumber and dill - it was served with a lemony-oil-vinegar dressing on the side. It tasted very fresh and light. \n  \nI had the pizza kono #6, which was filled with cheese, tomato sauce, vegetables and pepperoni.

I know Montrealers are convinced that \"fall off the bone\" is a compliment when it comes to ribs but I'm of the true BBQ school. Give me ribs with some texture and taste. Sadly these had neither. They were flavourless and overcooked - parboiled and then quickly grilled - not in any way BBQed. The smoky tomatoe sauce marginally redeemed them and the dipping sauce went well with the former but overall - not a dish I'd order again.\nWe shared a dish of crab cakes. Again, disappointing. Far too much potato filling left the three cakes wet. Little to no seasoning left them bland. As with the ribs the best part of the dish was the sauce - Aioli with a touch of soya.\nOverall I'd classify le Chien Rose as a slick concept that misses the mark - not by much, but by enough to prevent either of us from giving it a second shot.

After some deliberation, we ended up ordering the beet salad and duck breast to start, and then we shared the lobster with risotto for our entree.  All were fresh, light, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Our favorite of the night (and perhaps the entire trip) was the lobster. I will dream about that dish from now on!  An entire lobster tail and huge claw with roasted vegetables atop a mound of perfectly-cooked risotto.  At the owner's recommendation, we had a bottle of Marselan, which paired very well with our meal and did not break the bank. We also ordered the nougat with biscotti for dessert--a light and fluffy end to our meal.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant is calm, with dim lights and quiet music. It would be perfect for an intimate dinner. We had a glass of sparkling wine inside before moving outside to eat.

The Bhatura was not the huge fried bread that you see at most restaurants (see the picture I posted).  I wanted to go back to this restaurant during our trip to eat this again. Yes - it's that good.\n- My husband got Chicken Tikka Masala and cleaned out his plate.

While the menu is largely \"new French\" and has some interesting twists on old classics, including cooking with Unibrou beer as a primary ingredient, the food gives off the vibe of homely, French comfort food - it feels more traditional than it is.\n\nThe same goes for the restaurant as a whole. It's located inside the uber-chic uber-green uber-moderne Convention Center, but the dining area is meant to look like a Quebec countryside cabin. There's literally bundles of wheat used as decoration. The tables are long, massive slabs of mostly unfinished wood which reinforce this concept.\n\nThe service was gracious and you can tell that the proprietors take pride in not only their restaurant, but in acting as the welcome, happy face to the many tourists and convention-goers who come visit from all over the world.\n\nLastly, and most importantly, this is best place to get the freshest, most perfect glass of Unibroue beers on tap (Maudite, La Fin Du Monde, et. al) outside of the actual brewery, which is in Chambly about 15 miles away. So, if you can't make it out there, go here for the beer! The Maudite I had here was about 30 times better than the Maudite I'm able to procure in San Francisco. Don't ask me why...", "If you're looking for the quintessential fancy-pants nouveau-Parisian fare, this is it. \n\nAlthough the bread was not fresh-baked there was a home-made cheese-flatbread that was good. The French onion soup defines the dish and the rest of the food I had was pretty tasty, too. Part of the menu is reasonable prix-fixed fare, too, which is kind of nice when you have an expense report to fill out.\n\nNot only do they focus on French \"traditional\" cuisine, but they mix native-American foods and twists in as well. Caribou jerky, wild rabbit and deer, and salmon round out a very large menu. I had the chocolate-mousse cake for dessert and it was scrumptious.\n\nGiven that I have kids and that the wife and them may show up here in Montreal with me one of these days I took notice of the highchairs and kids menu. It is certainly pricey for kids, with $13 kids meals. In fact, there is venison on the kids menu here(!) I think mine will stick with the chicken fingers. Given that the place can get noisy; it has a high roof for aggregating sound, it may be a good choice for kids.", "As a craft beer fan, I've been to a number of brewers' food/beer outlets and am used to a smallish spot with good food and, of course, the beer.\n\nI was therefore quite taken aback to find that the Montreal convention center is the location for Unibroue's restaraunt.  The place is giant in terms of square footage; during our visit, a large group of 40-50 elderly folks were being entertained by a musician at long communal tables in one of two very large rooms.  We were one of two couples not associated with this group.  Needless to say, the presence of this place in a convention center near a bunch of international hotels makes the atmosphere palpably corporate and touristic.  This is what happens when Sapporo buys your brewery, perhaps.\n\nHowever, we were there for the beer accompanying food and were certainly not disappointed in this respect.  Unibroue's lineup is available on tap (about seven of their beers in this way) and all are available in bottle (340 and 750mL).  Tasting flights can also be ordered.  The beer speaks for itself.  High quality, belgian-inspired beer that is well-crafted.  Some items on the beer menu are in limited distribution in the States, so it was good to have access to them.\n\nFF, like many restos in Montreal, offers a multi-course Table d'Hote option and a slightly more comprehensive regular menu; items overlap between the two.  We ordered from the Table d'Hote menu.  Duck leg confit for me;  venison pot pie for Bridget.  The presentation was excellent, the duck was very tasty (slightly firmer than my preference, but still juicy and could be pulled apart with the fork).  Pot pie was excellent; meat was tender and savory.  \n\nThe service was friendly and responsive; despite being close to closing we were not rushed.  Happily, we left with a couple of bottles from one of Unibroue's limited batches.  \n\nWould we come here again?  Perhaps.  Given Fourquet Fourchette's location (not near anything else I like and absent a real neighborhood) and (perhaps uncomfortably large) size, and the fact that Unibroue beers are easily had at smaller establishments in Montreal like Bieres et Compagnie, it may not be necessary for a repeat experience."], "5": ["When I rave about my time in Montreal, this is another one of the places that comes to mind. As a former beer judge, naturally I am a fan of Unibroue beer. It was tantalizing to be so close to the brewery in Chambly, but alas we did not have transportation. Luckily for us, Fourquet Fourchette, which celebrates the marriage of gastronomy and beer, has a restaurant in the city, which was fairly easy to find at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s. The real treat at this restaurant turned out to be the menu itself, and having all of Unibroue's beers on tap was just icing on the cake. I've already mentioned that I am a fan of game meat. Well, the menu itself was full of game, which all sounded delicious (caribou pot pie, for example), I was having a hard enough time deciding what to get. Then our server came around and told us the daily specials, and that just made the decision even harder! The daily quiche was a quiche of game meats; the daily pasta was filled with duck meat and topped with bison jus; the daily seafood was some kind of local fish I can't remember; and the daily meat special was flank steak of horse. That's right, HORSE! I love Canada so much. Anyway, Vince got the horse and I got the duck pasta topped with bison. The horse was super flavorful, I was really glad I was able to try it. I loved my pasta because it was just crammed full of meat and topped with meat juice and more meat; no space wasted on silly things like cheese and sauce. For lunch, it was actually a super good deal, because everything came with a soup and salad bar, dessert and coffee. Of course we also each got a beer sampler, which came with Blanche de Chambly, Raftman, Chambly Noire, Maudite, La Fin du Monde, and Trois Pistoles. It was nice to be able to try the Raftman and Chambly Noire, since I haven't seen these in the US and they were lower in alcohol than the other Unibroue beers.

The mild one was buttery and delicious. The garlic naan was well prepared and fluffy. Having tried four other Indian places so far in Montreal, this was the one I liked the most.

For 36$ you chose one soup/salad, one starter, one meat dish, one veg dish, and one dessert. The menu had a dizzying array of choices so I requested the waiter to choose for me a set of dishes best representing the restaurant - with a request for spicy. \n\nThe first dish was a lentil soup with a clear base and very spicy with coriander. A nice taste to set the tone for the meal, hearty and warm. I requested spicy and they obliged with this dish - which was the most spicy of any dish served. \n\nThe entree was garlic shrimp. This was a miss for me. The sauce combined with the breading on the shrimp ended up being a mushy mess with a strange consistency. The shimps themselves were nicely cooked once you got through their soggy exterior \n\nThe veg and meat dish were served together. The meat dish was a very nice lamb vindaloo. The lamb was tender and very flavorful. The vindaloo curry was excellently spiced and not too greasy. I do wish it was a bit more spicy though. The veg dish was another lentil based dish with saffron, coriander, and garlic. A nice combo, but the taste could use some more pop. As a pairing with the lamb vindaloo it was good, but on its own I would find it a bit bland. \n\nThe waiter picked an excellent progression of dishes and the tastes went very nicely together. The service started as a bit indifferent, but warmed up over he meal with my waiter. Another waiter stood in for the dessert order and we were back to the indifference again.

Pricey for the quality-there's much better breakfasts in this town.  THere were good things and bad things: \nGOOD:  1. Very well executed eggs benedict, with spinach.  Very subtle and elegant. Potatoes were perfectly salty and nicely crispy. \n2.  Pain perdu was wonderful with accompanying compote of cranberry which was not too sweet.  The creme fresche too.  \n3.  Great setting and decor.\n4.  Friendly service, if a bit lazy. Manager did not seem warm and welcoming. \nBAD: \n1.   Green tea was badly executed.  Maybe 3-4 grams for 400ML.  Temperature about 190.  That is terrible, and tasted terrible.  It was prepared with a paper tea bag-most tea drinkers know that paper tea bags leave residual bad flavors, and this one did.  Green tea is supposed to be executed between 150-180.  3-4 grams should be about 120-180ml. \nWaiter insisted that the second green tea was called \"crocetia\" a Japanese tea.  I told him that I didn't believe there was any such Japanese tea, and asked him to bring the bag over.  He refused at first, and insisted that it was indeed Crocetia.  He  later did bring the bag.  It was not crocetia but kokeicha.  I didn't know if it was \"formed\" tea or \"twig\" tea, so I decided not to order since I was getting a pretty typical Quebec \"I don't know and I'm not going ot find out experience\".  The genmai cha was week, tasted bad and smelled funny.  The manager had to be told to take it off the bill despite my telling him the tea was bad.  Also a typical Quebec experience. \n2.  The smoked salmon was supposedly made by an artisinal smoked salmon maker.  They need to find a better one.  Lemeac has much better salmon with real character.  Lawrence as well.  Both make their own.  This is a high end place and this salmon tasted almost as though they were trying to replicate a salmon that people who frequent ordinary delicatessens in New York might like.  It's color and texture were disapointing.  there wasnt' the firm waxy smoothness or the smokiness of a good Scottish or Norwegian style salmon.  It tasted like cheap deli nova which in NY mostly comes from the same provider.  It is too soft, a strange color and lacks firmness, smokiness and good flavoring. \n3.  Presentation-great except for a pooling of grease on our plate under the potatoes. \n4.  Didn't offer additional coffee-had to ask for my wife who had said, \"maybe they charge for additional coffee\".  \n5.  No bread provided-perhaps you have to order it and pay for it.  \n6.  Prices were high and the product was not as good as other less pricey restaurants for breakfast.\n7.  Manager had to be asked to take the tea off the bill-seemd a little testy about that.  Should have offered when I cgave him my comments.  Did not.  That is unacceptable in a restaurant like this.  \n8.  Bagel was hard and dry. \n9.  Cream cheese was nothign special.  Tasted almost like store bought Philadelphia brand, though it was grainier.  \n\nI think maybe Daniel has too many restaurants.  Ramsay has the same problem. If you come to Montreal, you better make sure your staff is not carrying around a lot of Montreal service habits.", "Ok, Montreal is supposed to be a French town, so I had high expectation for our dinner at Maison Boulud.

This is a beautiful restaurant and bar. We sat at the bar and each had a glass of champagne. My bad for not asking the price. It was 28 dollars a glass. I think the bartender should have mentioned this.\nWe were shown to our table and offered water. It was easily 15 minutes before  someone came to take our orders. In the meantime someone else came by to let us smell the first white truffle of the season.  We kept waiting for someone to ask us about wine. It was never clear who our waiter was. It was at least 20 minutes and then our appetizers appeared!\nI suggested that perhaps we should talk to the sommelier first. They took the appetizers back. Another five minutes or so, and the sommelier arrived, as if everything was going according to plan. We explained what happened and she came back with wines to match our meals.  The appetizers reappeared and we had our first course.\nWe sat for awhile and then another person came by to tell my husband that several people had returned the veal  due to toughness so he did not want my husband to order it. Strange as I had seen a post regarding their veal being tough back in 2012 as well. He changed his order. The sommelier arrived with wine selections for our main course. We waited at least 20 - 30 minutes for our mains to arrive. About half way through our meal, we were out of wine. We could not get anyone to stop to get another glass. Eventually someone came by, then, they had to find the sommelier who had to find the wine and pour it for us.\nWe carried on as it was a special evening for our daughter.\nWe each ordered dessert. The the sommelier arrived back to say she was giving us complimentary port due to the problems we experienced. Then two people arrived back with two more desserts telling us they were complimentary due to the troubles.\nNo one thought to ask us if we wanted or liked port, or why 3 people who had already ordered desserts would want two more.\nThe service was just bad. The front of house seemed to be confused about who does what.\nThe bill was $550 before tip.\nWe have dined at Bouley in NYC and the bill was higher than that for two people,but was worth every penny.\nThis was not.\nI should say the food was quite good, but sadly the service really spoiled the experience.", "Located in the newly renovated Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Maison Boulud has all the ingredients to be a staple on the Montreal restaurant scene. Daniel Bouluds (of Cafe Boulud Fame in NYC) new high-end restaurant has been opened for nearly three weeks and has started to create a buzz. While the lunch and dinner menus look fantastic, it was the brunch menu that piqued our interest. There are only a few options available on the high-end brunch (Renoir, Cafe Birks), so this was a welcome addition.\n\nFirst, before getting to the food, lets discuss the restaurant itself. The space is quite large, but with relatively few tables and feels both busy and intimate at the same time. Expertly decorated, the centrepiece is the open kitchen, where Chef Boulud could be seen working the pans on a recent Sunday morning. Despite the renovations, the hotel decided to keep the inner garden, and the restaurant has a beautiful terrace overlooking the duck pond. \n\nNow on to the food! The brunch menu consists of entrees and main courses, available a la carte or in a prix fixe style. Though more expensive than your regular scrambled eggs and bacon (36$) the meal comes together quite well. Numerous salty and sweet options are available. \n\nFor the main course, everything from french toast to home made gnocchi to the classic hangover beater steak and eggs are available. We opted for two classic dishes, the gravlax with latkes and the croque madame. While far from extravagant, the attention to detail raise these two dishes from regular brunch to four star level. Not to be overlooked are the fries accompanying the croque madame which may be some of the best in the city.\n\nOur waiter seem to have no idea how to handle his completely packed section. Luckily, after long waits between arriving, receiving coffee and ordering, the very nice Maitre D' stepped in and took care of our service.\n\nFinal Verdict : We will be back, if only to spend a night on that beautiful terrace.", "I think we came on an off-night because our experience was nothing like all the spectacular reviews written about this place! :(\n\nHubby decided to bring me here for my birthday dinner a couple nights ago, and we were super excited given all the great things written about this restaurant.\n\n\nUpon arrival, our car was immediately taken to be parked ($16, not bad) and we were taken into the restaurant where our coats were put away and we were shown to our seats in the quieter area of the restaurant near the back terrace. The restaurant was clean, dimly lit, and well furnished. The main spectacle was the open kitchen where you could see Chef Boulud preparing all the meals (only saw this in passing since we were seated in a different section of the restaurant).\n\nWe initially wanted to order the degustation menu, but since they wouldn't tell us what dishes they were going to serve (surprise style), we decided against it as I'm a bit of a picky eater (ps. If you want the tasting menu, everyone on your table has to have it too.. Something I found a little strange). Anyways we ordered the following dishes:\nAppetizers: Cheese stuffed ravioli (was swimming in a soup kind of thing. Not very good.. Was missing something) and the cocoa marbled foie gras (ok but not as amazing as it sounds. It needed to be more..moist.. Also it wasn't too flavorful. Main dishes: Duo de boeuf (just ok. You can get better tasting meat at Gibbys...) and the Pot au feu (was so excited for this one... Came with several pieces of beef, one small cube of chicken with a crispy crust, and small pork stuffed raviolis. The beef was good, but again, better at Gibbys. The chicken was a little dry. The ravioli were undercooked so I didn't eat most of them). Side: wild mushrooms (hefty portion that we couldn't finish. Good but too salty) Dessert: Baba au Rum (so so disappointing) and the chocolate lava cake (finally something phenomenal).\n\nAll in all, the food wasn't really good...a 2/5..martinis were very strong and tasty so 5/5.. Service was impeccable so 5/5.. And prices are what you expect them to be so no comment haha. I'd give this restaurant an overall 3/5 for the great service and drinks but will definitely not be back....."], "4": ["It has been awhile since I've been to an upscale resto...\n\nMainly, the reason was that the food was less than imaginative and bland, it was always pricey and sometimes just lacking in terms of portions.\n\nWhat I liked about this place: it's easier to get a table than at Daniel in nyc, not suit and tie required as in Daniel.\n\nWhat I had hoped this place would be: a less expensive Daniel, less austere experience while keeping the same style of cuisine... not what happened... \n\nMaison Boulud is good food, but it lacks depth in the menu, three fish option, two beef options, no fowl or pork?? why? and foie gras doesn't count as fowl.\n\nOn to the food. We had butternut squash ravioli, seared foie gras, lamb shank rigatoni, and foie de veau grill\u00e9. For dessert we ordered pumkin tart with maple ice cream, and got something weird with mostly chocolate... go figure.\n\nThe ravioli was exquisite, just as good as any top resto in MTL. The foie gras was also amazing, well balanced with balsamic vinegar and figs, tasted very good but not the most original presentation...\n\nLamb shank rigatoni, the rigatoni was a bit tough, it was a bit hard and not so chewy, I don't know if it was on purpose but It wasn't a texture I like in pasta. The lamb shank   and sauce that went with the rigatoni was a bit too salty, my friend couldn't finish her plate. \n\nThe foie de veau (veal liver) was under grilled to my taste, I understand it is sometimes left just rare so it doesn't taste too pasty but the thing was almost all red. I like it medium or cooked but I guess that's just personal preference. It came with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms, I liked the taste just wished my liver was cooked, I should have asked for it, I'm sure they would have done it...\n\nThe dessert was weird, we ordered some pumpkin tart with maple ice cream, instead got this thing loaded with chocolate, whit had very little pumpkin or ice cream in it, the description didn't even have any mention of chocolate.

Especially with how small the portion was. Cannot believe this was in the main meal portion of the menu. Do not order this as your main, you will leave starving. The fig marmalade was good though, it went nicely with the foie gras. But again, would've preferred it warm or pan fried. \nThen we had the sweetbreads and duck magret.

The Brasserie T doesn't hold a candle on Holder!", "Disgusting ....\nDirty ...\nNever again.", "Don't eat here if you are pregnant:  Negligent, rude waitress, provides poor service.\n\nBrasserie T has been my all time favorite restaurant in Montreal for the two years I have lived here.  I take my office out here once every quarter to treat colleagues , bring business associates to lunch, my husband and I have dinner from time to time, and it is the very first place on our list when friends and family come to town. But our treatment today was truly terrible.  I left at 10% tip - something I have never done since I have also worked as a waitress and know how hard the labor is.\n\nDue to morning sickness, I had not been in about two months.  On arrival, I explained to our waitress, Marie Eve, that I was expecting and needed to know if the salmon confit in the daily special was fully cooked through, and whether there was any raw egg in the gazpacho.  She stated that the salmon was cured and then slowly cooked just like in the regular salmon and fennel dish that Brasserie T offers on its regular menu, and would pose no problem.  I was astonished, since I have had salmon and fennel dish many times, and while truly delicious, it is cured and therefore not suitable for pregnant women.  I asked Marie Eve if she knew whether there was any raw egg in the gazpacho, which some recipes use.  She said she did not think so, but did not offer to check.  I asked if she would please confirm with the kitchen.  Later, she came back to take our order, and I asked  \"Is it okay for me to have?\"  She nodded absently.  Unconvinced, I asked her if she checked with the kitchen as promised.  No, she had not, she said.  The restaurant wasn't full - we'd been there already for 20-25 minutes.  Again, could she please check?  She left, annoyed, and came back, and said it did not include the egg.  \n\nI ordered the gazpacho and a medium burger, and asked to have half fries and salad, something I have done every time I've been to lunch at Brasserie T for the past two years.  She then refused to take the order in this way, and said I would have to pay extra.  I said I had done this many times at lunch, and asked if this was a different practice at dinner than at lunch.  She became very insistent, and said I was wrong (!!!), that it was a policy at Brasserie T for all meals, since it opened, to only serve either salad or fries with the burger, and that I could add a side order.   I could talk to a superior if I did not believe her.  I was shocked, and stated that I understood she would not accept this, and was happy to make a separate extra order, but she should understand that this is the first I have ever heard of this practice, am a loyal customer, and am not lying about my past experience.  She sighed and glared at me.  I smiled back.  At that point, she finished taking our orders and did not speak to us again, except for 30 minutes later to ask if the four of us, all of whom ordered fries, would like one ketchup or one mayonnaise to share as a condiment.  (Again, Brasserie T has always offered us both without asking!!)  Belatedly she came by with one lonely half filled ketchup dish.   We asked for mayonnaise, she never brought it.   She never brought bread plates to my husband or myself - just to the other people in the party.   Three of four orders of meat were considerably overcooked. - we just ate, knowing it would be useless to engage again the obstinate Marie-Eve.  Other servers brought the dishes with the normal standard of courtesy we expect from Brasserie T.  Marie-Eve only returned to take our dessert order, and never told me that the item I ordered was garnished with - you guessed it - raw egg in the form of fresh meringue!!  We got up to leave the terrace at the end of the meal, and as we walked over the threshold into the restaurant, Marie Eve was in our path walking with one drink to serve on the terrace.  Instead of stopping to let us pass, and thanking us for coming, she glared at us and barreled right through our group.\n\nThe last thing I will note is that in all of my previous visits to Brasserie T, I have ordered and interacted in French with the waitstaff.  With English speaking guests we chose to speak in English.  I really cannot explain why we were treated with such utter indifference  - either Marie Eve is new and needs to learn basic manners or there is a different standard of service for English speakers at Brasserie T.  Based on my past experience at Brasserie T, I don't think they discriminate on the basis of language, but someone less familiar with the restaurant could draw that conclusion if they had a similar experience with Marie Eve.   Same for someone with legitimate dietary concerns trying to make the best choices possible - they might feel like the restaurant would rather not serve them. \n\nInstead of Brasserie T, we will now head back to M sur Masson in Rosemont, or O'Thym at Berri UQAM - both offer some similar choices, and dedicated wait staff that makes every effort to understand the customer's needs"], "2": ["Supposedly from Chef Normand Laprise, a big name in mtl cuisine, chef owner of Toqu\u00e9, and mentor of Martin Picard of Au pied de cochon fame...\n\npedigree aside, this place was disapointing, i live nearby and have been wanting to go for a while but they are always full...\n\nwent there a few weeks ago for brunch, was disapointed. we had duck rillette, potato au gratin, bavette de boeuf and some egg special with cauliflower mash... \n\nmaybe i don't like rillette, because i didn't like this one, the only good thing was the briochy toast that came with it. and i liked the pickles. \n\nthe bavette was a bit overcooked, and dry, it got a little tough to cut through, i asked for medium not well done...\n\nand it's quite pricey too, more style than substance here...\n\nthe people are pretty, and nice though :) always nice to be served by beautiful people.", "Two drinks, a mediocre goat cheese salad and the bill with tip was 40+ bucks.

It was pricey at $75, however if split among 3 its reasonable and MUCH more delicious than the basic flank steak on the menu.  The 1 kilo of ribeye, came with some mixed green (salad) two cups of frites, and a very good bernaise.  It was AWESOME! Also, not to be forgotten was the vegetable of the day.

It took almost 30 minutes to get our cocktails after we ordered them, and a very long time for the final bill.  Also, dang it was HOT in that restaurant.

To our surprise, the restaurant was far from packed, although outdoor seating was mostly taken.\n\nThe food was really good. We didn't order any entrees; Instead, we got the charcuteries platter (good to share between two people), which included duck rillettes (divine with caramelized onion), foie gras terrine, cured ham, and pork saucisson. Some of the charcuteries were only ok, but some were amazing too... The foie gras rivaled the pate at NYC's Bar Boulud.

Slightly annoyed but too embarrassed to request another table change, we stayed put. But it elicited grumbles from my boyfriend.\n- Second, it took foreeeeeever to flag our server down for the check. It was as if she forgot about us after our orders were put in.\n\nBased on the hype (from the Toque connection and NYT review) and menu prices, I had certain expectation about the restaurant as an overall experience.

I, as well as a few others, ordered the bavette, which sounded amazing at the time, but once we received it, ALL of our meat was way overcooked. Meat like that is way too tender to be overdone, and we all ordered it either rare or medium, in turn we all received medium-well and well done. It was the most chewy and stiff meat I have ever eaten. The only thing tolerable on that plate was the fries --another aspect saving this rating from being a 1-star.\n\nMeh. I've experienced WAY better (sorrynotsorry).", "Very disappointing experience. It looks like a nice cafe with a terrasse.  But it was horrible. Here's why: \n1. We were asked to move after sitting down outside  for 15 min  because the hostess didn't bother to ask if we were eating or just having drinks. I don't even know why we had to move for eating, but we didn't want to be complicated so we agreed to move. \n2. The waiter had no knowledge of his alcoholic menu. I ordered sangria and he said he didn't have sangria. Asked for an old fashion and he had no idea what I was talking about. Ordered a cosmopolitan and he asked if I wanted a vodka or gin martini. I was so confused over just a drink! \n3. The only good part of my dinner was the appetizer. Tuna tar tar. No complaints there. Fish was fine. Nothing out of the norm, it was good. \n4. We arrived at 5 ish and received our main dish at almost 630. We were unable to find our waiter several times. Appetizer dishes not cleared, my empty cosmo was only offered a refill at the end of my meal so I said no. And obviously couldn't find him for the bill and even when we did, he took so long I had to leave to get my car while my friend had to front my part for the bill. \n5. Not only did my food take forever to come, it tasted horrible!  It was WAY too salty my brocolini with sausage. All I did was drink water after almost ever bite because we had to leave by 7 and if I returned it, we would have to wait another 45 min probably.   My friend's pork stuffed with blue cheese lacked blue cheese AND was over cooked. Was way too dry. \n\nThis restaurant is worth one star but i will give them their one credit, their appetizer was par. \n\nWill I come back? Never"], "3": ["We enjoyed a late lunch on the outdoor patio during the first week of June 2010.  The service was good, the food was excellent and the ambiance was nice.

Among the four of us we tried lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs and a half cheese/ half mushroom pizza.  The restaurant is small, and clearly is a popular local / McGill hangout. We arrived at 11:30 for lunch, and by noon the restaurant was half full. The pizza was very cheesy, with the type of crust that I think of as Greek (rightly or wrongly).

Food was without any character and tasted mediocre. Good ambience and service but sub par food!!", "Tourist trap! Don't be fooled like I was!\n\nIf you have a lot of money and don't know what to do with it, why don't you just give it to me? I'll make you something! I swear it will be more delicious than what you eat here, and I've never even been to chef school. \n\nNotable: Place has nice bathrooms with nice-smelling mango hand lotion. Maybe stop in to pee on your way through Old Montreal? \n\nUnfortunately, that was the only notable thing about this place, other than the way-too-high prices. Oh, we also liked the free baguette w/ olive oil way better than our entrees. Shared some of the house red with my partner, which was fine. We came here because it was all that was open, we were sick of wandering around on a -30 day, and they had some veggie options on the menu.\n\nI would put the food at maybe a 1.5 or 2, but combined with the exorbitant price, it is definitely a 1. My partner had a pasta dish and also rated it as a 'meh', which was unfortunate since I think it was around $30, more expensive than mine. I got some kind of veggies put on top of each other like a leaning tower of pisa, and the smallest little lump of quinoa you ever did see. The side salad, also miniscule, was clearly made with the 'spring mix' you get from a box at the grocery store. It is smart to judge a place based on its salads - if the dish is more than $10, a box salad green mix is completely unacceptable IMO. The veggies - I would argue boring veg fare, as they are in like every single vegetarian dish made by people who do not understand how to do anything interesting with non-meat items - included zucchini, red pepper, and tomato, all of which were saturated in oil as to be almost tasteless. Sat way too heavy in my stomach, and way too little quinoa to help balance out the oil from the veg. Newsflash, just lopping excess oil on something does not make it 'gourmet.' \n\nService was fine. I got leftovers in a take-away box but ended up throwing them out. (I NEVER DO THAT.) Couldn't bring myself to eat it. Too icky.\n\nProbably the worst value for dollar I have gotten in a LONG time."], "2": ["Stopped by here today, first day in Montreal,   at the suggestion of the concierge at my hotel.\nI walked into Old town, which is enjoyable. And did not have a hard time finding the place. The waiters were very kind and did not mind speaking 50/50 French and English with me. ( I am very rusty) I was seated promptly, and received bread, butter and my drink order pretty speedily.\nI looked over the menu, and decided to go with the tapas, which I was told included risotto, some stew, a (Spanish) tortilla, and a mini-open faced style tuna salad crostini. the waiter was pretty much correct, except, to my chagrin, the risotto with chorizo ended up being replaced with some sort of extremely unappetizing calamari. Points off for the inaccuracy of the dish description, and the indescribably bad, extremely heavy, overly spiced, strange textured calamari, which turns my stomach to think back on. The stew was fine, a bit tough, but good flavour. The tortilla was a bit over spiced too, actually (think too much liquid smoke) and the sort of \"tuna crostini\" that rounded the dish out seemed to have been sitting out for a bit.\nThe positive was my $5 \"green salad\" was huge, and the vinaigrette had a lot of interest, not sure what they put in there. It brought out the happy Californian in me to see so many beautiful baby greens. And as I have said, the service was very friendly, and efficient. Strangely, the butter came in little single service plastic tubs, though, which seemed a bit cafeteria style, of such an otherwise trendy spot. Also, The sangria was decent.\nI will probably not go back, but that is not entirely the fault of the restaurant, it just seems there are better places around for the price. Would have loved to have tasted the chorizo risotto!", "Staying in old Montreal for two weeks and have eaten at nearly every restaurant surrounding this place (Venti, Bocata and Barroco).  Those restaurants are phenomenal 5 star places that would stand out in Manhattan.  Les Pyrenees however has bland food and poor service and is quite a bit more expensive than the much better restaurants nearby.  Our server really had a bug up her butt for some reason.  It's worth noting that another server, a taller gentleman was very friendly.  He actually ended up getting our check for us and ringing us up.\n\nAlso worth noting is that their pasta is clearly store bought.  Not the end of the world, but it was $23 and the night before I had hand made Bucatini with bacon and a rich sauce at Venti for $9.", "For the price, I was certainly underwhelmed.  We were a party of four adults and one child and ordered wine, appetizers, entrees and desserts.  We wanted a taste of the tapas, but the waitress said we would need two. The sampling on one plate was more than sufficient.  The celery soup was watery without sufficient flavor. The pasta was over cooked and the sauce, although nice, lacked the warm smokey spiciness from espelette peppers.   The monkfish was nice, but the dishes seemed to be hit or miss.  We sampled five desserts and the presentation on two looked like they wiped off a chocolate dessert and put the next one on.  The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was perfect, the orange cake was acceptable and the mousse was average.  Overall, I would expect better quality at those prices."], "3": ["This restaurant, serving basque cuisine on the border of downtown and old Montreal, is very popular among the crowd I find myself with in Montreal.  The food is good, but I had problems getting descriptions of the dishes from our server, and in fact, consensus at our table was that what he brought me probably wasn't what I ordered (but it was good, and I was kinda undecided anyway, so many things sounded good!).\n\nI really don't like the fact that they push the Sangre do Toro on people -- almost every table had it, and despite my protestations that it was a cheap supermarket table wine, our group got a bottle as our first.  When I picked something else as our second, everyone agreed that it was a marked improvement.\n\nThe server also suggested the most boring-sounding dishes.  Between the food suggestions and the wine suggestions, I felt a bit like I was in a standard tourist trap.\n\nSo the food -- 4 stars;  but the service attitude knocks off at least one.  By all means go if you're in the mood for this cuisine, but make sure you do your own work on selecting food & wine, and be ready to roll your eyes at the tourist treatment.", "Sometimes you end up at a place because it is just there. Maybe your blood sugar has dropped so low that even eating a cough drop can make the difference between a sane functioning person and a version of Jack Nicholson with an axe in the movie \"The Shining.\" I wasn't quite at this point, but I was close. We had passed cafe after tourist filled cafe and then we turned a corner and there stood Les Pyrenees, kind of lonely on the street. Being about 2:30pm only two tables were full (not necessarily a good sign) but unless I got at least a glass of wine to tide me over I was about to become very evil. We stepped up to the menu and the Maitre D' swooped (literally) from inside and asked if we would like to come in. I know I was startled and we said \"not yet.\" I quickly scan the menu - tapas, seafood, lamb...I can't focus...let's just go in, I need a piece of bread, quick. We were quickly seated next to the other two tables maybe they should have spread us out more to make the place look busy? (ok, I will stop nit picking). Anyway, the server stopped by our table and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I couldn't get the word \"wine\" out of my mouth fast enough. Sensing my sense of urgency - the glass appeared almost immediately as did the bread. I had some random Sauvignon Blanc - but it was actually good and the bread and butter made me feel normal again. Having been to Spain, I was reluctant to order tapas in this location so I settled on Lamb (braised for 12 hours? I can't remember in my hypoglycemic stupor) and my brother decided on a salade, fish soup and shrimp risotto (as you can see I was so out of wack I didn't even order a salad or appetizer as is the norm for me). The salad was fresh (nothing wilted) and had a nice vinaigrette. The fish soup was also quite good, not too rich, not too salty, perfect temperature. Definitely hit the spot on a sunny afternoon. Now the plat principales were brought to the table and to my delight there was quite a bit of lamb. It was tender and well seasoned. My only complaint was regarding the unintentionally crunchy potatoes - just cooking perhaps 10 more minutes would have taken care of that. They were hidden under the lamb (perhaps where they belonged). The risotto was lovely, smooth, creamy, teaming with shrimp (and most important - not crunchy at all). This turned out to be the best risotto I had on this trip. We watched as they brought desserts to the next table - they both looked so delicious. Sadly, we did not partake in this course (and now I am regretting it!). This meal was solid and I thought the price was right. I like the ambiance of the place and we joked around with the wait staff and I had what I called a life saving experience in here. I had no complaints about the service, the food (except those darned crunchy potatoes) and my overall experience was very positive.", "I went here because Gibby's was too busy. It was a quiet, fine dining looking place. The service was fantastic. I ordered the 12hr braised lamb and I thought it was pretty good. My one complaint is the prices are high, but not too much different than the rest of Montreal. I would recommend this place if you can't get in one of the other places like Gibby's. We had a couple of desserts and neither were very good. We also had the tapas appetizer which weren't that great."], "4": ["Oh come on, this place wasn't so bad! In fact it was pretty good.\n\nI thought all the dishes were tasty, and they all were plenty of food. We picked our own red wine, so we didn't have to get pushed by the waiters to pick crappy wine. My entree was the dish with chicken and Spanish chorizo. It was definitely excellent. \n\nOur desserts were all huge! I got the creme brulee and it was way too much for me to handle.\n\nI'd recommend this place for anyone looking to get some French food, Pyrenees style.", "We walked to the Old Town and came across this quaint little restaurant and looks at the menu posted outside.  A waiter came out so we decided to give it a try.\n\nPrix fixe was very reasonable.  I tried the liver and it was nicely done in a balsamic vinegar sauce.  I had a glass of Bourgogne Pinot Noir that was nice.  The dessert was a fancy plate with a desert wine soaked cake center.  Nicely done and great value.", "5 stars by far!!! We stopped for lunch while riding our bikes.  We were not dressed as nearly well as the other patrons.  But Edwardo was very welcoming at the front door even with our 2 kids ages 9 and 11.  We felt out of place.  Since we eat fish and vegetarian not many places have lots of choices, but here they had plenty for us choose from.  My kids ordered the eggplant veggie lasagna and the goat cheese cake with veggies.  They loved it.  Our son Justin wanted to eat every meal there.  I had the mussels which was an incredible value. It was beyond a big bowl for $13.95! Edwardo took great care of us and made feel very welcome in our bike gear.  We would totally go back.

Lucky that we did arrive here.  The staff was amazing- friendly, informative, efficient.  Our wonderful waiter didn't try to oversell us.  I'd keep on suggesting to split things from the menu with my husband, who ordered the paella, but our waiter cautioned me \"Madame, he will not be able to finish!\".  Who else could get away with calling me a Madame without me kicking them in the shins?!  \n\nMy brother had flavorful cold melon and mint soup with his prixe fixe.  So good.  Wanted to lick the bowl clean!    Our toddler turned her nose up at the broccoli and leek soup- no worries as the rest of us devoured it.\n\nMy husband's colleague stopped by on his way out and recommended the chorizo.  A superb recommendation.  I ordered a half portion of the risotto with chorizo and shrimp, but guess who at most of it?  Our bug.  Luckily, I pressed for a salad even though the waiter thought we were getting too much food.  The waiter was delighted that our bug gobbled up most of the the dishes.  Well, ok, so did we.  The paella was chock full of seafood and she had her first octopus there.  She ate several, making me worry that she might choke on it.  \n\nFor dessert, my brother couldn't decide on the included raspberry mousse or an apple cake which would cost more.  Our trusty waiter steered him towards the mousse which was tasty.  I couldn't decide between any of the many choices and got the classic profiterole.  Stuffed with ice cream.  Chocolate sauce.  SOLD.  Hubby got a lemon sorbet, which the bug promptly hogged.  After a tasty dessert wine, we toddled out of Les Pyrenees.

Back in the 70's this place was top notch.  One of my wife's favorite restaurants.  That was a time when the Queen Elizabeth Hotel had a half dozen excellent restaurants down along the concourse.  \n\nYears later the whole complex was scaled back or closed.\nThe Beaver Club was cut back in space by 50% or more and went from top notch to tacky under different operators.\n\nI can see from the new web site that the space has been transformed to its original elegance.

I had heard that the grandeur and glory which was Le Beaver Club had been dismantled in the '80's, but restored in recent years.  The restaurant holds far too significant a place in my personal progression of understanding and appreciating a fine dining experience to go without a review.  Now that things are again right, I'll write my piece.\n\nHaving just graduated high school, Montreal was where I most wanted to visit for a few days of get away.  The \"fancy\" dinner for this trip was Le Beaver Club.  An evening which began with some griping about getting dressed up for dinner, ended with my first appreciation of how a truly extraordinary meal had the power to excite my senses, to transport them to places I had never known to exist.  The elegance was apparent in everything which caught my eye, and yet remained approachable to this eighteen year old on his best behavior.  The differences between \"eating\" and \"dining\" were suddenly neither semantic nor subtle.  I can't honestly recall what I had for dinner that evening, only that it was an important cog in my first true dining experience.\n\nLe Beaver Club was revisited several years later, while on our honeymoon, with the recollection that what was great on the first visit was even better on the second.  A fresh visit will be needed to assess this gem of a restaurant among my adult dining experiences, thus a star is withheld-- for the moment.", "Service was lacking.

The atmosphere was polished, and, strangely, quaint, the service was very attentive, and the price was quite reasonable.\n\nMy flank steak, cooked on a bed of fresh spinach leaves, heaped over potatoes, was cooked exactly as I asked (med-rare), and the portions were generous.  The chocolate mousse was rich and delicate, and the whipped cream was, of course, homemade.\n\nWhat really stood out here was the coffee service.  Never in my life have I had a better, or more memorable, coffee experience, while dining.  For under $3, I was brought an apparatus- the only way I can describe it.  \n\nOK, to be more specific, coffee was served in a brass coffee brewer that operated from a candle, and, over the course of 10 minutes, brewed, filtered and poured (by front spigot) 3.5 mugs of fresh coffee, right at the table.  The coffee was accompanied by an entire tray of accessories, including three types of sugar, homemade whipped cream, two typed of shaved chocolate, etc.  As someone who usually drinks my coffee black (if the quality warrants it), I couldn't help but try some of everything.  It was exquisite.  The complementary chocolate truffles were a nice finishing touch (though, there were so many of them, I might have skipped dessert, had I known).\n\nThis restaurant will always be on my to do list for any trip to Montreal.", "This was a great experience, from beginning to end. My boyfriend had gone to Montreal (from NYC) for a bachelor party a while back, and being foodies, the boys had tried to get a reservation, to no avail.\n\nSo, when we headed up to Montreal with friends for Labor Day, we made reservations three weeks in advance for Saturday night.\n\nLocated in the Fairmont hotel, the restaurant itself looks less fancy than I would have thought - very hotel restaurant-y.  Yet the service and food was excellent, from beginning to end.  \n\nAppetizer:  They first brought each of us a small bite of salmon, which was unexpected, and as good as a small, uncooked piece of salmon can be.  For the actual appetizer, I ordered the asparagus wrapped in goat cheese.  It was TINY but unbelievably good.\n\nMain: Two of us ordered the blackened cod, which was excellently cooked - the fennel puree, carrots and asparagus on the dish were delicious (and I've never had a delicious carrot before).  My boyfriend had the arctic char, which came with a sauce so good that we were almost licking the plate at the end.  The veal, ordered by our fourth, was also excellent (or so he said).\n\nDessert:  In between our entrees and dessert, they brought out a little fruit cuppy thing, which everyone was split on.  Not the best, but certainly not bad.  If anything did detract from the experience, it was the desserts.  We had a tiramisu (which was good), two types of chocolate cake (both just really okay) and a strawberry mousse cake that some enjoyed, but overall was not a big hit.\n\nCoffee came with 3 different types of sugar, shaved chocolate and delicious whipped cream.  I was in heaven.\n\nThe waiters, maitre d and sommelier were wonderful and seemed to genuinely enjoy having us there.

The wine captain assisted with finding an earthy red that we reasonably priced.  Everyone assisted in a friendly comfortable manner.\n\nThe fois gras was delicate and creamy.  The duck crispy on the outside and tender inside cooked to my desired medium rare finish.  \n\nDesert was a perfect cr\u00e8me brule\u00e9 served three ways in egg shells.  Pistachio, traditional, and grand marnier.  The presentation was elegant as was the delicate composition.\n\nThe only downside was a large group that arrived near the end of our meal and was seated next to us.

It's a small restaurant so definitely reserve because it was packed to capacity on the night I came.  If you are just two you can also consider sitting at the bar.  The space is very welcoming and features an open kitchen so you can see the owner and chef Luciano D'Orazio cooking up magic in the kitchen.  Pricewise it is what you would expect for a restaurant in Petite Patrie\n\nThe restaurant has a small, focused menu which is generally the way I like things to be done.  I've said it before and I will say it again that it is best to focus on doing a few things well then trying to serve up everything and winding up serving only average food.  They have a few pasta dishes and one meat and one fish dish.  Now I must admit I do wish that they had one or two more meat and fish dishes but you still have a good selection of dishes to choose from.\n\nI started with polpette which I'm pretty sure were made of veal and garnished with padano.  They very juicy and tender and covered with just the right amount of sauce.  That was followed by pappardelle with braised rabbit and shitaki mushrooms.  This for me was the highlight of the night.  They served the pasta slightly al dente which is how I like it and since the rabbit had been braised it just fell apart.  They also didn't try to cheat and make the dish mostly pasta.  The serving of meat and mushrooms was quite generous.  Dessert was a Nutella ricotta tart which was well balanced in flavour.  You could taste the ricotta layer without the Nutella overpowering everything.  The portion size was always just right for everything.  I always felt like I had enough to eat without feeling like I had gone overboard.\n\nBe warned that the bread here is wildly addictive.  They drizzle it with olive oil and toast it before sprinkling salt on it.  Normally the bread is such a minor detail of a restaurant meal but here it is so good you could almost just eat that for the whole meal.  If you are not careful you will fill up on bread leaving no room for the other amazing food that you will eat.  Let's just say that it boded well for me that I was absolutely starving when I came because I did enjoy that bread quite a bit.\n\nThe waiters do a great job here of paying attention to the customers.  I don't think I saw them stop moving once until the end of the meal when the restaurant was starting to empty out.  They were constantly topping up empty glasses, bringing out plates and checking in on diners to make sure they were well taken care of.\n\nIt does get a little noisy in the dining room and I wasn't crazy about that.  I'm not a fan of having to scream at dining companions when I eat out.  I have definitely experienced worse though.  On a whole this restaurant is an awesome addition to the neighbourhood and definitely worth the visit."], "5": ["Luciano est un super chef et tout ce qu'il vous pr\u00e9pareras comme repas seras pr\u00e9pare avec soins et minutie , les saveurs sont toujours bien doser, bon choix simple et chic", "What a fantastic restaurant !

French food . . . large portions . . . friendly staff . . . lots of space.  The only very very slight downside is location, as it isn't right next to a metro or in an area I frequent regularly, but it isn't all that far of the beaten path either.  And after trying it, it's worth the detour!\n\nThe staff are great.  I was the first of my party to arrive, and it felt like every single staff member came over to ask if I needed anything.  Not in an obtrusive way either, just in a friendly sort of way.  Our waiter was very friendly and rolled with the punches of our good natured group.  He took the time to explain how the menu worked, and give some recommendations.  \n\nThe food was delicious.  I would love to go back when I had a larger appetite to be able to sample more.  On this night however, I just had a main, and even that alone i had a hard time finishing.  French restaurants often get the reputation of small portions, but Tablee Vin has definitely taken on the North America standard of large portions.  In future I would like to try their menu de degustation, which at $48 includes a soup, a starter, a palate cleansing sorbet, a main and desert.  That seems like a great deal for the amount of food, as well as the quality and presentation.\n\nThe bring your own wine is the icing on the cake.

The one star is because one appetizer was half decent and the server removed one item off our bill that was inedible. \n\nWe were seated in the bar area, which was extremely bright, red lights illuminating from the bar, irritating to the eyes. It was not a pleasant dining experience.

The arancini was the best item we had. The bolognese sauce had good flavor however the risotto cake was dry and spongy. \n\nThe crust of the margarita pie was cooked well. The mushroom\\prosciutto bottom so so badly burnt it left a terrible bitter taste in our mouth. It was inedible and our server took off of our bill.  \n\nWhen it was time to pay, it took an awful lot of time for the server to bring our bill over (15-20 minutes at least) and she was nowhere to be found.

Le d\u00e9cor de Bevo est vraiment cool! Des chaises transparentes qui pendent de l'escalier, un bar avec une lueur rouge intrigante, des murs de pierres et de brique non recouverts et des tables de bois font de cet endroit un de ceux avec les designs les plus cools de Montr\u00e9al.

Not really, I like weird things - I once sprinkled vanilla ice cream with crunched up bits of BBQ chips, don't judge me, try it! So she cut me off a slice. The savouriness of the generous topping of sausages went really well with the toothsome bite of the roasted mushrooms. The overt sweetness of the tomato sauce was apparent through the cheese and egg.\n\nI didn't know what to think about having chopped up eggs on my pizza. I bit into it and the strangest thing happened. The waitress came over and asked how everything was, and before I knew it, she threw her apron into the air, the other servers pushed the tables aside and the manager jumped down from the second floor via swinging from the oversized chandelier in a choreographed dance. They broke out into song about how eggs have been shunned by the other pizza toppings for so many years and was fighting to find its own identity. It all ended in a rousing crescendo where everyone paused, threw their hands into the air and yelled, \"EGGS!\" No, not really... but eggs on this pizza really stood out - the powderiness of the yolk and that overall taste of egg was the kicker that tied everything together - how I never tried this before, I don't know.", "Everything was fabulous!

Can't find anything comparable to Bevo here in Boston. If you still have room for dessert, I definitely suggest you try the gelato. It was a twist of pistachio, vanilla and chocolate.

YEAHHH", "This place offers good Indian food and it's good for those times when you crave Indian food and want to pig out on curry, lamb, chicken etc. The have a variety of dishes, fresh veggies, fresh fruits and the standard Indian fare. I appreciate the fact that they tell you which dishes are really spicy so the customers will not have an unpleasant surprise I also like the fact that I know what I am eating, if it's chicken then it's real chicken, same with all the meats. It's not a fancy place, probably I would not bring here a first date, but I would come with friends and family to eat some nice Indian food. Maybe they don't have that little cake they make at the village of Brahapur (made up name, btw)  in Uttar Pradesh, or the chicken Shalala (made up name again) they serve in Goa, or the exotic stuff some gourmets might expect, but as far as Indian food goes this place hits the spot, and fills generously the belly. The waiters are from India, so they know there is a wide world out there and have no problem whatsoever with English-speaking customers, and seem to be friendly and helpful. Will I come back?...you bet.", "Some friends and I went for lunch a few weeks back and for sure ill be back. I love a good Indian buffet and this place did not disappoint. The buffet is huge with lots of options for me as a vegetarian. Lunch price was more than reasonable. Decor is bright and airy. If I could say one thing it would be the desserts (not like I needed it) , the icecream was generic out of the tub and wasn't a big fan of the rice pudding. A lot of the other desserts as well sort of looked like something you'd find in a cafeteria line. But as I mentioned it was just as well because I had already eaten more than necessary trying to get all my favorites in."], "5": ["In contrast to the other reviews I really enjoyed this restaurant.  Maybe I just so happened to go there on a night when they were on point.  Or maybe because I live in Boston where we are really lacking good, authentic Indian food.

I have been craving it ever since and been so disappointed not to be able to find anything similar locally.  Next time we're in Montreal we will definitely go back!", "Surprised by all the bad reviews. :/ \nHubby and I ate here today. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.

I know this is a tourist trap, but I'm from NYC and thought I could handle it.\n\nI came here because they have a pretty descent beer menu.  My boyfriend and I were seated right away by a polite hostess right outside.  We received menus and that's it.  That is where the service stopped.\n\nThere were 3 waitresses running a total of maybe 12 tables outside and not a single person even brought us water, looked at us - nothing.\n\nWe waited and waited.  I stared the hostess down and tried to get her attention from 4 feet away but she didn't care.  Only one waitress was manning a few tables well but apparently we weren't in her section.  I tried to get someone's attention, as did my boyfriend. \n\nA couple who looked like had been sitting there for 5 minutes longer than us finally received their beverage 20 minutes after we were there.  So after 25 minutes, we got up and left.  We couldn't take it anymore.  There were about 4 or 5 tables in the same position as us.  Didn't get to order, with menus on hand trying to hail down waitresses that were busying chatting it up and looking busy inside but actually doing nothing.  Believe me, I was watching.\n\nThe food looked crappy and overpriced and the beers weren't worth the effort.  If I could go up to the bartenders that were clearly under worked, I would have.\n\nSteer clear or spend the end of days waiting to be served.", "Look up in the sky....is it a french restaurant? A German restaurant? An English pub? Or how about a Mexican restaurant? Neither, this place was having an identity issue. It was however the worst restaurant I have ever encountered. Baaaaad service, warm drinks yummy! It was grimey and smelly. We were going to order food, but it looked awful at the next table.\nHostess was hot.......but dumb as a stick. \nWe ended up at MCdonalds.", "I don't give out a whole lot of 1 stars...maybe I should just end it there! ;)\n\nBefore I start I guess I should say that I should have known better to find a good lunch stop in the heart of tourist town.\n\nThe service was terrible.  Pretty much the worst I have had.  The person seating us was great and we were off to a good start.  Then it took 20 minutes to have someone even come over to us.  The wait staff was buzzing around, avoiding eye contact completely.  We finally had someone come and ask if we'd like a drink.  Two of the people in my party asked  a couple questions about their extensive list of Quebec microbreweries.  They have a ton of selection on there but no description as to what the beer is like.  The waitress told us she doesn't know anything about beer and was making us feel uncomfortable for taking so much of her time asking a question.  So I ordered a few I thought they would like.  So a restaurant with dozens of specialty beers but she doesn't know anything about beer...\n\n10 minutes later our beer arrived, we went to order but she said she will come back to take our order.\n\nNow we are easily 45 minutes into our lunch and haven't even ordered food.  Again, it was obviously painful for her to come to our table and take our order, (table of 3 people by the way).  She said she will come back with more drinks at that point as well.  The food took an average amount of time to get to us and it was not our waitress and there were no drinks.  I would've like vinegar with my fries, but did not see our waitress through the whole meal.  Yes, our glasses were empty for the rest of the meal.  No water and no bread either...I mention bread because a funny thing we noticed, (with all the time on our hands), was that every table that the other waitress was serving had a basket of bread...none of the tables that ours was serving had bread.  That probably would have slowed the service down even more.\n\nI went inside to use the washroom, spotted our waitress and just asked for the bill.  As she brought it over I got the evil eye stare like I've done something wrong...an hour and a half to eat a sandwich and fries, (which cost $18 or so), no water, no 2nd beer...and I have somehow offended her.\n\nThis is a bit of a rant, but hey..."], "2": ["Here I am, visiting the second most beautiful city in Canada (obviously after Vancouver) and after a five hour flight I am pretty much starving to death, (that little packet of bits and bites didn't really cut it.)\n\nThe crew decides to head out and find some pub grub, so we head towards old Montreal. We stumble upon Le Fripon, since it is one of the few places that has a couple of veggie menu items, and most pubs don't seem to have much. I order a cesar to kick off my vacation, and the pizza with artichokes, red peppers, onions, and other veggies. My cesar arrived and just by looking at it, I knew I was going to be disappointed. Cesars should have a dark red colour from not being watery and from the addition of worcestershire sauce. \n\nThen my pizza arrived. Can you tell me what kind of restaurant serves a pizza cut only in half that is stuffed with fries in the middle of it??? W.T.F? Ok. I know I am in Montreal, which wanted to be its own separate country and all, but are they really *that* different over here? Not only was it super hard to hold a giant half pizza and eat it, (because its blasphemous to eat pizza with a fork and knife), but the sauce on the damn thing was like a spaghetti marinara sauce. The sauce made the cheese slide off the pizza because it was runny, which made the pizza have cheese leprosy. \n\nI ate the fries, they were actually pretty good, and had half of the pizza packaged up for the BF to eat when he is hungover, because BF's can be like dogs and eat anything when they are drinking. Not that dogs drink, but you get the point? My bill was like $27, which was a bit pricey for such crappy food. Needless to say, I think that this place is just a tourist trap because of its location, and there is this horrible ballad singer/busker outside that pretty much ruined our dinner by singing a cover of \"Tears in Heaven.\"", "Great beer selection, mediocre food.\n\nThe mussels mariniere with pommes frites is generously portioned and one of the better items on the menu. The best part about Le Fripon would have to be their outdoor seating - they have a terrace right along Place Jacques-Cartier, which is perfect for people watching.", "5 stars if you are looking for a outdoor patio with good service and cold drinks for people watching along Jacques Cartier......\nWe ordered the Fish and Chips as well as a Fripon Pizza - fries were pretty good but the meat on the pizza tasted bad funky and the fish was below average.  On a positive note, the service was excellent."], "3": ["This place is in the popular section of Old Montreal.

It was starting to rain in Old Montreal, and there was a cute hostess here, so we decided it was time to stop for lunch.\n\nThe food was average... they had a wide variety of menu choices, but no real specialty, so nothing was great, nothing was really bad.  The pizza on a baguette looked more like a cheese-sandwich to me... I guess it just depends on if you eat it open-faced?  Also, the croque-monsieur looked exactly like the pizza, except for the added ham.  Our waitress was nice, but a little inattentive.  When we asked another waiter for something, he told us that \"our waitress could help us\" (in other words, \"not my problem\")... that was disappointing.\n\nDespite these, the patio was a nice place to sit, even during the midday showers today, the TV in the bar had ESPN on, and the full bar had a *huge* selection of beers from around the world, so I'll give it three stars.", "Came for the outdoor seating on a lovely summer night with our 3 kids.

We ordered a Croque Monsiour for the two bigger kids to share, and somehow ended up with chicken breast instead of ham.  They were hungry and dug right in and loved it, but it was certainly not what we ordered.  We didn't say anything because the kids were happy to eat what they received.\n\nI got a salmon burger which was a little dry but otherwise decent.  Hubby got a bowl of french onion soup which he enjoyed but said it wasn't anything amazing.  He finished what the kids didn't eat for the rest of his meal.

Said poutine was made with grated mozzarella instead of cheese curds (no excuse for that in Montreal, come on). The waitress wasn't really apologetic which we found a bit offensive considering the scale of the screw up. We ordered the churros for dessert and the waitress told us there would be a \"5 minute wait\" (we thought it a bit strange that she would mention that since 5 minutes is a perfectly normal length of time to wait for a course to be served, if not short!) - they arrived 30 mins later.

So that's good!\n\nThe libations were very good. I had a Cuba Libre that was good but quite plain. Rebecca had a Jack Daniels lemonade that was quite delicious. I then tried the Thai basil Mohito and found my drink of the day! It was absolutely beautiful. Splendiferous. Rebecca's second was a conventional mint Mohito which was excellent as well! There were also complimentary maple whisky shots; a pleasant surprise. \n\nOkay, I am vegetarian and I went here with my omnivorous partner for an early dinner on Taco Tuesday. She quite enjoyed the lobster roll as well as the oysters. I am fully aware and sympathetically understanding of the fact that vegetarian fare may not be the prime and foremost concern to the average restaurateur; this is totally cool and I've got no beef with anybody on this point. Here's the however part. However, mostly every restaurant I go to has at least one or two good token vegetarian options. Cartel ... not so much. The guacamole was average if not bland and there wasn't too much of it either. The tortilla chips, however, were in abundance and were standard / average Mexican resto chips. Not to be boastful but any guac will turn out average when compared to my own home-made guac goodness and also nothing beats some nice organic blue corn tortilla chips. The avocado and plantain tacos were something cool to think about but were quite lacking on the taste front. They work in theory but not in practice. We need a little more ingenuity here. Seriously, anything can be a taco! The world is your taco! You can be as far-out and as creative as you want to be with different flavour combinations and ingredient selections and such and at the end of the day if you put it on a flat corn tortilla and call it a taco ... it's definitely a taco. I've had some damn good vegetarian tacos. Namely at Ta Chido on Parc in the Mile-End, Grumman '78 on Courcelle in Saint-Henri and Restaurant Amaranto on Monkland in NDG. These are some awesome and out-of-this-world tacos. \n\nCartel: I totally may just give you another chance because your drinks are really good and I like your atmosphere but you've totally got to step up your flavour game.

We called, they had a table for us, and we were off to a great find. This place has unique dishes at a reasonable price.

The waitress suggested that three sharing plates plus some appetizers would be an appropriate amount of food and she was right. \n\nFrom the sharing plates we ordered the top three (duck, chicken and pork) and to start we ordered guacamole, crispy wontons, duck wraps and oysters. Everything was fresh tasting, full of flavour and tasty. I would have liked for the food to be spicier, but I know that a lot of people are looking for less spicy food. It has enough flavour that the low spice wasnt' a deal breaker for me. \n\nFor that food, plus drinks and tax (but before tip) we ended up paying a bit more than $150, so the prices are very reasonable.

We're staying in a hostel close to Montreal Poutine and wanted to get something to eat that was close, we were hungry and we thought we'd give this place a try. Bad idea. \n\nThe man, who I assume is the owner, pressured us to come into this tourist trap. This crazy guy was chasing people around the street, LEAVING his restaurant, and saying \"Bonjour! Bonjour!\" and \"Monsieur! Monsieur!\" to people, FLAGGING them down to come into his restaurant. I felt so embarassed for him. He obviously had no shame, and good for him! However, I would be a little hesitant to beg people to come into a restaurant that was not going to impress people in the least. He was quite obnoxious and I was rather turned off by his pushy attitude.\n We were given a seat outside, and within about 10 minutes we were visited by our server, who I almost ignored because he was wearing an \"I love poutine\" shirt, and approached us from OUTSIDE of the fenced dining area. To be honest at first I thought he was a complete stranger. We ask for a diet coke, and a regular coke. \nThe server returns shortly with two drinks, with 2 or 3 disintegrating ice cubes floating on the top, and proceeds to tell us he forgot which drink was which, and left us to figure it out. Let me paint the scenery a bit for you. Small porch. 5-8 people on the whole patio, and TWO at our table. Did he really forget which drink was which between the time he walked from the kitchen to our table? They were extremely flat by the way, and tasted like they had been poured a long time ago and left to sit until someone ordered them. I have never even heard of something so absurd.\nThe local ordered a burger and I ordered a smoked meat sandwhich. The food was okay, but the smoked meat was not at all what it is supposed to be. Our server never returned to ask us how we were, if we needed anything, or if he could refill our flat, disgusting sodas. Oh! By the way, don't expect free water. You get a bottle and its $2.50. He thinks. He didn't quite seem to know.\nThe bill comes and we want to pay with a card, so we go inside and obviously we're not impressed by what we've experienced, and didn't want to give the average 15% tip. My friend asks to put 13% instead, since the guy isn't letting him hold the machine himself, and the server is practically in shock. He says that %15 is standard, and they don't go below that. Ummm, excuse me, I know that 15% is \"standard\" and \"polite\" but as far as I know, a tip is a tip, a tip because you DID YOUR JOB WELL! Why should I give you extra mpney if you can't even meet basic performance standards?! He then asked my friend if he was from Canada, as if he was stupid and didn't know how much to tip in a restaurant. My friend says \"Yes, I'm from Montreal!\" and ends up having to give the guy the %15 because obviously he's not budging. \n\nMontreal is a beautiful city, and words can't even describe how wonderful Old Montreal is. I have had nothing but delicious food and amazing service since I've been here, but I can safely say that even outside this city, Montreal Poutine was probably some of the worst restaurant service I have ever experienced, and their food was barely mediocre.", "Service took forever.\nAnd there were ants in my sangria.

Pizza tasted kinda funny but I ate it anyways. Big mistake, my stomach totally hurts now :(\nAfter all that, it took well over 20 minutes to get the check, and we were still charged for the sangria.

The portions were generous, and the food was fresh and delicious! The poutine consisted of perfectly done thick fries, drowned in gravy with a good amount of cheese curds, topped off with tender pieces of smoked meat. My chicken caesar was big, yummy and fresh too.

My fiance had the poutine with smoked meat and I had the chicken, apple and brie sandwich- no poutine (I figured I could share). The portions were huge - I had a pile of fries on my plate (even though I had asked for no fries). The poutine was okay, not as mind-blowing as fries with cheese and gravy promised to be. My sandwich was so delicious. The baguette was perfectly toasted and the brie and apples were a great compliment.\n\nThe service was hurried and not very accommodating. i asked for no cheese on the sandwich, which they said wasn't possible.

And because I had a seat facing the window, I noticed that every time someone walks by and looks at the menu, he magically appears to \"lure\" people in.

Anyhow...\n\nHungry, looking for a quick and tasty bite and acting more touristy than I'd care to admit, I stopped in Montreal Poutine looking for some good Canadian fare. Having heard a little about poutine, I was initially surprised to learn that the base poutine was in fact vegetarian (I later found out that this isn't an uncommon occurrence, but at the time it was a selling point). I ordered the avocado fries and poutine with mushrooms and onions. The avocado fries had the most interesting texture and came with a little pot of creme fraiche (excuse lack of accented letters), which ended up being the perfect dip -- I wouldn't have wanted anything more complex.\n\nPoutine is most certainly not my specialty, but I was pleased with what the server presented me. The onions were well-caramelized, the mushrooms were small and tasty, and the fries were a little too small for my tastes but otherwise very, very good. Those two dishes were not quite enough for two to share, but I definitely would not have wanted my own plate. Pair with a glass of sangria and it made for a very tasty late lunch.

There are many bars open but it is hard to find something to eat, unless you come to Montreal Poutine, which delivered beyond our expectations.

We had the burger with the poutine fries and we were pleasantly surprised!  It was almost like a delicacy -- sirloin and cooked perfectly, red in the middle. The salad greens that came with it were amazing, fresh and tasty.  Also had the \"best beer in the world\" as stated by our waiter - the Blanch de Chambly - which is a Quebecois beer which is oh so good; refreshing, light, citrusy.  Almost like a Blue Moon but not as thick.   Would definitely come back here for another burger.", "Excellent poutine!  If you're here in the summer, eat in the back garden!

French fries, gravy and cheese curds comprise the base of a poutine, but quality establishments can raise this basic variety into an art form. \n\nMontreal Poutine does just this. \n\nThis wonderful eatery has two different seating areas: one indoors, which looks a bit like a rough-and-ready chip shop type place - somewhere to grab a mess of business to go and walk about the International Quarter.  A few steps away, however, is a dreamy outdoor courtyard sheltered on all sides by green leafy branches, with just the right amount of glorious sunlight illuminating the wooden tables, the miniature gardens and water fountains, where one can feast in arborial splendor. \n\nMontreal Poutine sells more than just the Canadian delicacy, to be sure - their flatbread pizzas are tasty as well, but I was here for the glory, and the glory I would have.\n\nI got no further than the section titled \"LE SMOKED MEAT\", and my choice was made.  \n\nSheer joy:\n\n- Gravy perfection\n- Gooey, melted cheese curds.\n- Fries crispy where they remain untouched by the delicious brown\n- cubelets of what can only be affectionately dubbed \"Le Smoked Meat\"\n\nMother of pearl, this was a wonderful meal - with a couple large pints of Sleeman Lager (another uniquely Canadian treat), I could easily have passed into the next world satisfied with my experience. \n\nOverly effusive?

Can hang here for hours.", "Simone and I just got back from another trip to Montreal, Canada. I love going to Canada for this reason-  Poutine. Although it sounds kinda dirty to say it, Poutine is actually a food. French Fries (preferably fresh cut) topped with Gravy and Cheese Curds. Simple and yet one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth - and I'm not telling you what other things that list includes. In my opinion (which of course is always right) the best place in the city to get Poutine is in the old city, on 161 Rue Saint Paul, at the smartly named Montreal Poutine.\n\nThe restaurant is divided into two areas, one for seating and one for take out, and its oddly separated by a gift shop in the middle. In the summer there is also outdoor seating along the street.  The day we went it was 20 degrees outside so inside dining was the only choice.  When we got to the door we tried the latch and couldn't open it. Obviously we thought the place was closed. However as we started to walk away a gentlemen (who was either homeless or worked there) let us know to just give the door a push, so thus we did and we made our way inside.  Once in the door we looked around for a minute at the empty place and waited to perhaps see a waitress, after a few moments a rather attractive young lady popped her head out from around the corner and offered us a seat. She apologized for not hearing us come in and I explained to her that it was okay and that she had just missed our wrestling match with the front door. She informed us that not only did the door not work, but neither did some of the lights, the toilet or most of the windows and because the restaurant is divided into two sections she was actually going to have to walk through a window to the outside and around the building to place our order and then bring us the food. Not noticing her wool hat and heavy sweater, I laughed and thought she was kidding.  She informed me that she was not at all kidding and that \"being an old building, the waitresses get screwed\" Wow ! After the honest opinion that she shared with us I could only think one thing- lets eat some Poutine !\n\n The menu is pretty simple. There is about ten kinds of Poutine, a small sandwich menu ( including Montreal's other famous dish smoked meat) salads, and  very good Pizza flat breads. For my choice I went for the classic Poutine, and a smoked meat sandwich. Simone got a little crazy and had her Poutine topped with Mushrooms and Onions. When the waitress opened the window and stepped through with our order I thought it may be a good time to take a picture. I however decided not to do this because people don't usually enjoy being screwed and having it captured on film. Later in the meal , I did manage to get a photo while she did some entry window insulation repairs and I must say she looked good both entering and exiting the window.  Now back to the meal !\n\nMy Poutine and smoked meat sandwich arrived and both looked great. The home made French Fries were topped with vegetarian gravy ( that tasted like some really fresh roasted chicken pan drippings) and loaded with a generous portion of mild cheese curds. The dish was not at all salty and the cheese had just started to melt into the gravy that was coating the crispy hot fries. YUM,YUM,YUM.  The smoked meat sandwich was also delicious, It had a mountain of thinly sliced pickled beef brisket resting between to slices of moist Rye bread.  It was tender and smokey and served with mustard . I finished every last bite. The plate also came with a small salad on it, which was a bit of a waste for me, but Simone took care of eating it.\n\nSimones mushroom and Onion Poutine was like mine, with a vegetarian ( still tastes like chicken) gravy and cheese curds. I thought the onions were a bit overpowering and took away from the flavor of the rest of the dish , but i did enjoy the mushrooms.\n\nI love this place. It definitely has an old city vibe. The brick wall are falling apart, the windows rattle, the door is broken and the waitress have an honest but fun attitude. Its the real Poutine experience with no frills, just really good food.

The focus throughout the menu is local product, lots of delicious wine and beer choices, including one of my favourites this summer, the Dieu du Ciel Disco Soleil IPA.\n\nWe ordered the kale salad (with plums and roasted nuts!) and mackerel (huge pieces with sumptuous plump raviolis tucked between) as starters, and the gnocchi main. Portions were way more generous than recent fancy dining might have led you to expect, and everything was incredibly delicious, but the gnocchi was the super star and I'll go back soon just to wrap myself around that.

Weekends seem crazy though, based on the buzz walking by, so I'd book anyway just to be sure. \n\nService was prompt, cool, chill, friendly and very knowledgable about the wine. The only off note for me was the one waiter who repeatedly said things like \"the wine menu is entirely full of triumphantly beautiful choices, or; everything on the menu is perfect and very special.\" I love the enthusiasm of his delivery and moustache, but personally I think it's better to stick to describing details that are special then let the items speak for themselves rather than spouting superlatives.

I had the \"French toast\" which is not normally something I would get, but it sounded so interesting that I had to try it. I'm so glad I did.

Not all items are available on the lunch menu, however (seaweed salad, for example).\n  \nThe makis are okay/good for an all you can eat place, which I think tend to be held to lower standards than a la carte sushi restaurants.  They wouldn't fly at an upscale sushi place, but we come here to pig out :P  Sometimes the flavours seem to have melded a bit (from being made a bit in advance?), but they're okay regardless.  The vegetarian maki with the pickled radish is pretty good, as are the california roll and the spicy salmon roll.  There are many more sushi/maki options available for dinner. A word of caution: don't order scallops from the wrong part of the menu.  And don't accidentally order six of them. You will be served giant raw scallops. Gulp. With a $1 charge for every piece left behind. \n\nFrom the kitchen menu, the edamame beans are always a hit, and the general tao (yes, at a sushi place!) is pretty good, as are the teriyaki beef and chicken.  The tempura shrimp are nice and crispy.

To supplement the all you can eat menu items you can order they also have little sushi boats on one of those conveyor belts  that are popular in Japan, but at least when we were there there were not enough clients to assure that the circulating sushi was really fresh.

I noticed they had mason jar cocktails, and being a fan of the Distillerie that immediately got me interested. If that's your thing too, don't get your hopes up. The two jars I got to taste (mine and my wife's) were both far, far behind Distillerie' in terms of quality and taste. All of the choices seemed very much on the sweet side, which is not too much my thing, do I decided to play it safe and order a Mojito. First big disappointment. Mojitos are always a hit with me, except this wasn't a mojito at all: they served me rum and lemonade with a twig of mint stuck in it at the end just for the look (the mint needs to be crushed first otherwise it won't give any flavour at all).\n\nWhen the waiter came to ask about the drinks I thought I'd mention it in case it was a mistake. Second big disappointment. I barely had the chance to start talking that he was already running away. I was able to stop him and explain, and his answer was that they couldn't crush the mint because of all the ice in the jar. 8-/\n\nFood was the third big disappointment. I got the Mad Greek, because I felt like something fresh and had great Greek themed burgers in the past. This wasn't one of them. First I find burgers are to thick, so good luck eating it with your hands without making a mess. It didn't help that the Greek toppings were too juicy and completely falling off the burger. Now that would be fine with me, except that the burger was also tasteless. I had a poutine on the side, and was also turned off by the sauce.\n\nNow in this whole time we saw our waiter 3 times in total, including taking the drinks then food orders. He hadn't brought any water until we were half way through the meal, didn't ask about the food, and took over twenty minutes to notice we were done with our plates. Mind you in the meantime the restaurant was getting more and more empty. I even had to chase him to get the bill.\n\nNow at this point I was fairly disappointed with the experience, and might have given it a 2 or 3 stars. But then came the killer. I decided to leave a 7% tip, which I thought was generous considering the 2.5 minutes the waiter spent at our table, the rushed attitude and the few words. First thing he does one I pay is look at how tip I left, right in front of me. HUGE mistake in my book, something I NEVER did in my years of working as a waiter. But I play along. He asks if I know tip isn't included (duh, I just left you 7%). I say yes, then following his confused look I ask him if he's wondering why is only 7%, which he was of course. When I tell him I was disappointed with both the food and service, his answer was \"Well don't come back, okay?\" with the kind of superior attitude any respectable waiter I know would never dream of having.\n\nWell guess what, I was definitely not planning on going back, now I regret leaving any tip at all."], "2": ["I really wanted to love this place, unfortunately, all around it fell quite short.

There was no spicey \"buffalo\" to it at all and the chicken \"cubes\" were tasteless for the most part.  My friend ordered the Mac Beef Baked Potato and she seemed to enjoy it more than I did mine.  I tried hers and also found that it was rather tasteless.\n\nThe staff was not all that great as well, our server took forever to bring a refill and it wasn't very busy.

In the end, I think it's a really chill place if you're down for a drink - but as a restaurant, I don't think it's anything special.\n\nLet me start by saying their drink list is extensive. They have wine, spirits, absinth, beer, really anything you could think of - plus their share of unique cocktails, all of which sound amazing. I tried a cocktail called the Pacman, which looked delicious and tasted even better, and I'm definitely going to go back to try many more (all?) of their drinks. \n\nThe vibe is great, too. The rustic decor plus the crowd kind of makes it feel like a really trendy bar instead of a restaurant, which I think is great. The music might have been on the loud side, but it wasn't anything unmanageable. Our server was super nice, too. No complaints there.\n\nReally, the only thing that didn't leave a lasting impression on me was the food. I had the Beauty burger with fries, and the meal comes with coleslaw and a Kool-Aid pickle. My favourite parts of the meal were the coleslaw and the pickle; the burger didn't stand out as much as it should have, and the fries weren't the best. \n\nAll in all, I've had better hamburgers and fries.

My girlfriend had booked one large table for all of us and when we arrived we were given 3 booths because of an apparent error in our reservation, on top of this problem the service was really slow and poor and the waitress hardly understood English which I usually don't mind at all but in downtown Montreal in a very touristy area where I had friends from out of town who couldn't speak French and I had to order for them it kind of bothered me. \n\nApart from the service the big positive is of course the food and the bar. I was overly impressed with the quality of the beef as well as the quality and freshness of the toppings. On top of that the drink menu is phenomenal with a lot of selection as well as a good selection of quality local and domestic beers. The only complaint I would have is the bloody ceasar they serve might be a little too spicy for some people (although I like it that way)\n\nTo sum everything up I would give the a solid 3/5 because of the food, but many improvements can be made with the quality of service offered here especially at the price you pay.", "Good food, good service but it was beyond noisy and it was not even the ppl talking but the music!\nIf you want to eat a good burger but don't care what your friend at the other side of the table has to say then you have found THE PLACE."], "4": ["Not just another gourmet burger joint!\n\nThe place is huge, just opened few weeks ago.

I emailed their concieirge to see if there was anything special they could do for them. the responded asking when I would like to make a reservation. \n\nconfused I called and gave them the confirmation number as well as a copy of the email. They said they called the software company that handles their online reservations. \"Softbooker\" had a record of our reservation but they did not because it was lost or erased some how.\n\nThe woman says there is nothing she can do....there are no tables. I reluctantly rescheduled for Friday night...the night we would arrive from a 10 hour drive.  \n\nAs expected we drive get lost and had no time to relax or even shower. I called the restaurant to let them know we may arrive earlier. they said that was fine. I expected better treatment...given the pain and inconvenience their system had caused.\n\nBoy, was I mistaken. \n\nFor the record I work for the Omni hotel, and I know that we have given away amenities for lesser things, even things that were not our fault for example, street construction noise! or a loud wedding party.\n\ni expected they would know exactly who we were and that we had issues and would try their very best to make it up to us.\n\nWe arrive at the time we said with a reservation and with a call ahead of time and they had no table set for us. There were two tables in the entire restaurant. and this is at about 715 on a Friday night.\n\nI ask the waiter if we can sit in the private room and he says \"that's for reservations....\" I explained the whole sad story and he very reluctantly said it would be a while to wait. \n\nSo we sat in another room admired the decor. Looked at their outdoor patio and looked at their birds. All of it looked very nice. I will give them that much.\n\nfinally our table is ready ( an hour  after calling them with our arrival time)\nOur waitor comes in. He is stoic throughout service.

The atmosphere is simply exquisite--both quality, with silk curtains, stately gilt appurtenances, and massive, carved antique furniture; and comfortable and lived-in, with unplastered old stone walls, an inviting fire blazing beneath the imposing mantel, thriving Boston ferns, ancestral portraits, and even charming avian residents, including Pedro the Blue Macaw, Chico the African Grey, and Coco the Budgie.\nThe service was similarly impeccable--our server was charming, attentive, and friendly.\nThe food was excellent, hearty Quebecois fare--the hot, rich goat cheese puff pastry was particularly welcome in the freezing weather!  My dining companion ordered the maple cake for dessert on the recommendation of the server, but I passed, not being a fan of maple--and I deeply regretted after I tasted it.

The cocktails we eventually settled on were tasty and brought in a prompt manner. \n\nLatter in the evening though our waiter told us that the couches were reserved for bottle service and that we'd have to stand at the bar.

It's not as if we weren't buying several rounds either. \n\nI explained to the waiter that I have some health issues and that standing for the night was night an option. He set up a small table and chairs for us which remedied the problem and made me very happy. He also said that he'd continue to wait on us. This is where the real issue began. \n\nAfter waiting for about 15 minutes with empty glasses in front of us I went to the bar and asked the bartender to make us a drink and that we had a tab with the waiter. She refused to make the drinks and said she'd send him over. I was pretty annoyed and decided it was time to get the check and go elsewhere. We waited for about 10 more minutes and the waiter never came over. I asked a busboy to send the waiter over with the check because we wanted to leave. I would have told this to the waiter, but this bar is enormous and was now packed.

Ordered the beef tenderloin rare and it came out perfectly medium rare.  I'm a genius. It was very good. The rabbit billet app was described by the waiter as a pate and supposedly amazing. It kinda sucked. Well it tasted exactly like cooked tuna fish from those cans (chicken of the sea), so if u like well cooked chopped up tunafish u ll prolly like it. Not my thing - that said I finished the whole thing as I was hungry. The carrot soup others had was not bad.  Dessert was pretty good.

A great place to start before a night on the town.  They had a fab outdoor patio, which I'm sure must be a fantastic place to be in the summer!  We had the sushi which was delish.  Their other entrees were also great - my friend had the duck, which was great, i ordered gnocchi (b/c I love gnocchi), and I think rabbit and sea bass was ordered.

But I was really disappointed...\n\nI had read here on Yelp about how wonderful this place is, and made a special effort to get there. When I arrived I was impressed - quaint and pretty cosy, and a great welcome from the staff. Not to mention a glass of wine while I was waiting for a table. So far so good!\n\nThe server introduced herself as the owner, sister to the chef. She was charming, and described the menu, and the specials. She mentioned that one of the dishes took her brother five days to make, and I considered ordering that, although, when I asked her whether I should choose it or the special, a steak, she recommended the steak (aged 30 days) in a red wine and shallot reduction. So that's what I opted for.\n\nThe first course was an onion soup, with a hint of jalape\u00f1o. It was phenomenal!\n\nWhen it came to the steak, though... She asked me how I liked it. I like medium well. My brother will refuse to go below medium, she said. My eyebrow was raised. Oh, I said. (Now I know some of you are thinking, well, if he says he prefers it cooked more than medium-rare then he knows nothing about food. Trust me - I know what I like; more to the point, however, the philosophical question is, who should be the arbiter of taste, the chef or the patron? And if it's the chef, then why offer a choice at all?). Still, I agreed to the medium...\n\nWhen the steak came, it was fine. Tender, yes, and not too bloody for my taste. But how come there's nothing else on the plate? Yes, there's the red wine reduction. And there's a hint of pureed sweet potato. Liquified, really. But that's it. No vegetable, and definitely no potato - roasted, boiled, dauphinoise, french-fried, mashed, croquette, or fried. Is it possible to get some french fries, I asked? No, came the regretful reply, we have no fryer.\n\nOkay, no fryer - but couldn't the chef have considered an alternative? Shouldn't the waitress have asked if I would, given that, prefer something else? No.\n\nMeanwhile, the red-wine and shallot sauce was... bland. It's not hard to do a red wine sauce. EvenI can do it. I look for the salt. Where's the salt? Nope, none available. Sigh.\n\nMaybe dessert will be better. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a coffee. The coffee comes first. Watery. It's either instant, or an americano made with poor espresso.  My last resort, the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e? The custard was curdled.\n\nFinally, I go to pay the bill, no concern evident on the part of the servers that I didn't drink the coffee, and that I took only two teaspoons (one to taste and one to confirm) of the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.

The soup was fairly good, I can picture it served anywhere else still popular but definitely not the baguette came with it though. The pork belly lived up to its fame I guess. Cooked to the spot and served with interesting sauce.\nFinally, the mac & cheese, wasn't quite French in my opinion. It's mac&cheese with truffle oil topped with a huge pile of pulled pork I guess.

The tartar was so overwhelmed with the taste of green onions and capers that the kangaroo was nowhere to be found. The tiny green salad was useless.

The chefs, who are also your waiters and someliers in this open kitchen environment and who my wife referred to as \"the band of brothers\" head out every morning to the Jean-Talon farmers market to see what is available fresh that day.  From what is available, the evening's menu - which differs daily based on what is fresh - is planned. There are a few menu staples that last from night to night like the spectacular foie gras with half a dozen or more different preps - each of which are taste bud elation! One of the foie gras preps involved cooking it in a dishwasher! No joke! Between the 10 of us, we sampled virtually every menu item for the night. Not a single member of our party was disappointed. Everything was exceptionally prepared from the pan fried scallops, the filet of dore to the 1.5kg filet of beef for two (sit across from your sharing partner - the plate is huge!). You must save a bit of room for dessert which shouldn't be difficult as I am convinced that there is a separate stomach for desserts when they are as good as those at the Kitchen Galerie!

And what does the 'Supreme' mean?\" The response I got was simply, \"Dates\". That was pretty much how all our conversations with the waitress went. But terrible service aside, the biggest disappointment was the food itself. Nothing was necessarily BAD, but nothing was particularly GOOD or memorable either. They also seem to love their foam machine a little too much. While making cucumber foam, or pea foam is interesting, the textural element was used as more of a novelty than a compliment, as it was used on half the dishes. The meal ended appropriately. When asked, \"What's the 'Death by Chocolate'?\" The waitress responded, \"Mousse\". Turned out it was chilled and closer to ice cream. Overall I would have given the meal itself closer to a 3, maybe even 3.5...but such horrible service is inexcusable.

The polenta and wild mushrooms were also delicious, definitely a good choice! \n\nI had the highly reviewed veal sweetbreads and I was not disappointed.  Deep fried and soft inside, the sweetbreads (my first time ever trying it) was fantastic.  This dish also had a fairly large amount of food on the plate and I was surprised how well the yellow beats complimented the parsnips.

The restaurant itself is your typical Indian restaurant and it smelled good and is literally across the street from the Laurier Metro; super convenient. Perhaps it is because I ordered my food to go, I don't know, but it was watery, lacking spice and was just plain 'meh.

The naan bread, though, was not as good as it could be - I've had much, much better naan. \n\nWe showed up very late, like about twenty minutes before the kitchen was closing at 11pm, and were still served but asked to make a decision quickly. Our gracious waiter served us water out of a reused 2L Evian plastic water bottle (hilarious? or in bad taste? I'm not sure) and poured it like it was expensive wine. Kinda hilarious, actually. I ordered a martini, which came in a short water glass with ice cubes, not a martini glass, and was not a real martini but one of those pre-mixed \"martini\" drinks. OK, so it's not classy. However, the d\u00e9cor was quite comfortable and cozy, though I was a little turned off by the fact that the table cloths were not removed and washed after dinner guests had finished their meals and left - the waiter would simply come over with a damp cloth and work hard to scrub off any food stains that might have happened. My date and I were laughing up our sleeves as we observed this slightly absurd behavior. \n\nMy recommendation: try it once. If you don't mind spot-cleaned table cloths, water served in re-used plastic water bottles (with the labels still on them and very worn out, I might add), then you'll find a good plate of food.

Honestly, I was so disappointed and confused by all the misleading ranting and raving that all I have the urge to say is \"What's wrong with you people?  Have none of you ever had good Indian food in your lives?\"  Perhaps my expectations -- shaped by a mind-blowing Indian meal at a childhood friend's house and excellent Indian dining experiences in Kuwait -- are too high. I've been on a quest to match those amazing culinary experiences for years now.  Malhi Sweets certainly didn't come ANYWHERE close.\n\nHere's what we ordered and my impressions:\n\nChanna samosa: Very mediocre. Not as tangy and satisfying as I've had at other restaurants (e.g. at Bombay Mahal on Jean Talon.  I've also heard that the channa samosa at India's Oven, also on Jean Talon, is excellent.)\n\nPapadam with a dipping sauce: Meh. It was nothing special, though my boyfriend enjoyed the dipping sauce.\n\nButter chicken thali, which was served with daal makhni (black lentils in sauce), channa (chickpeas in sauce), salad and a whole wheat roti (I asked for this instead of naan):  I was SO disappointed with the butter chicken; the chicken was dry and flavourless, and the sauce lacked the typical rich, creamy, buttery consistency of a good butter chicken. The daal and channa both tasted the same to me and were both BLAND. The salad and roti were also bland.\n\nLamb thali: My boyfriend ordered this, and I had a little taste of the curry sauce but not the lamb itself. I was not impressed.\n\nBasmati rice: My boyfriend was the first to serve himself some rice and his immediate reaction was, \"Would you taste the rice and tell me what you think?\"  A strange first reaction when you're talking about something as straightforward as rice in an Indian restaurant.  This is what I thought: it was unusually dense and not particularly flavourful.  Left me confused and yearning for some aromatic, fluffy basmati rice instead.\n\nThat's all I'll say about the food.  The service wasn't particularly attentive. And what's with showing patrons their bill total on a calculator?  I'd like an itemized bill please.\n\nGlancing at the newspaper clippings in the window as we left, I couldn't help but wonder why on earth Catherine Deneuve would choose to celebrate her birthday here of all places.  I won't be coming back.", "Having been exposed to Indian cuisine my entire life and on numerous continents I am always on a quest to find that authentic Indian restaurant experience here in Montreal.\n\nRecently my search led me to Malhi Sweets. \n\nI found the decor to be bright and refreshing as opposed to dim and dingy like a few resto's in the area but that being said, environment was never really at the top of my expectation list. I know that sometimes the best of ethnic foods can be found in establishments that won't win any awards for choice of wallpaper or quality of the chairs.\n\nWhile Indian cuisine is so much more than just \"butter chicken\"- it is usually the reference point of comparison for the restaurants I try, as I take it to be one of the more popular dishes and a staple to many patrons. This one was disappointing. The sauce was not nearly as rich and flavoursome as one or two others I have tried and worst of all the chicken was extremely dry. \n\nI was quite surprised that the Thali did not come with rice so we had to order rice after our Thali's had been placed in front of us, but to their credit it did arrive soon after. Unfortunately the rice was not the light and fluffy aromatic basmati that you usually expect from Indians but was more dense and still slightly \"wet\"- perhaps a couple of more minutes in the cooker would have done the trick.\n\nThe service was a bit disjointed and haphazard but good food always compensates for that. When it comes to service, I don't come down hard on \"mom and pop\" establishments that are reasonably priced.

The wines were reasonably priced, and the service was attentive and friendly in spite of the fact that I've forgotten almost al the French I ever knew and had to rely exclusively on English.\n\nAs a tourist I only ate here once, and I can't compare it with other Montreal restaurants, but from my limited point of view, this place was everyting I was looking for and helped rekindle my love of Montreal.  Highly recommended.", "This is a great French restaurant, with a typical French bistro style. The service is usually great, and the food is excellent. Remember to bring your own wine since they do not sell wine there. The location is really a big plus as well. Unfortunately, it close for lunch and on Sunday (I think).", "Cozy, romantic atmoshpere with an authenically Quebecois feel.  Food was fantastic with highlights being French onion soup, duck confit and profiteroles.  Hangar steak was tasty but should have arrived sliced as it is a tough cut of meat.  House wine for $16 a bottle was the icing on the cake!"], "5": ["Got this recommendation off of Yelp and it did not disappoint: delicious food, great service, reasonably priced. \n\nThis is a a little restaurant on a beautiful, quaint pedestrian street, Rue Prince Arthur E (the E/east is really important!).  At the restaurant, the service was great - very friendly and welcoming, yet also unobtrusive.  \n\nWe started with the tomato basil goat cheese tart- holy schnarkies, it was unbelievable.  The pastry was so light it pratically floated off plate, yet each bite was also deliciously buttery. How? How does that happen together?! Don't know, but it did.  \n\nHubby a flank streak with pomme frites, I went skirt steak- not too exciting of us, I know.  But still, A Table made these simple selections delicious- both steaks were perfectly done and the french fries that could have been boring-weren't.  Afterwards, we strolled along the street towards Louis Square, which had really interesting architecture- all around great evening.  Highly recommend.", "Loved. Loved. Loved.\nThe Hubs and I came here for dinner on our last night, and we were SO happy we found it.  \n\nEverything we had was delish.  We did the prix fixe and we had the escargot, french onion soup, two beef dishes (i forget which ones we got) and ended with the apple pie-ish thing, and the best creme brulee I've ever had.  EVER.  \n\nI can see how in the Summer, when they open up the doors and have the outdoor seating, it would be a great place to have some wine, eat some great food and just hang out.", "\"this neighborhood looks a bit sketchy, Mike.\"\n\"meh, I've been working out. plus I have a knife on me.\"\n\"WHY DO YOU HAVE A KNIFE ON YOU?\"\n\"you never know, there could be gypsies.\"\n\"I'm not sure that's a politically correct term.\"\n\"you've known me for 6 years and you think I'm going to care about political correctness now?\"\n\nyou emerge from a train station. walk through a somewhat sketchy area into a very nice area. down one street and find yourself on a cobblestone street. is this the middle of some Parisian suburb? the nicer areas, not the ones near the hotel you stayed at during that trip back in 2005, which led to some interesting stories...\n\nyou are at Les Deux Gamins.\n\nyou ask what duck confit is. your waiter, Samuel, explains. it's roasted duck which then gets fried in its own drippings. oh, and they fry some potatoes in those juices too. plus a salad on the side, for the illusion that you're eating healthy. it's only $20? really? sign me up.\n\nyou proceed to destroy one of the most beautiful pieces of cooked poultry you've experienced. the meat falls off the bone; the skin is crispy; the bones are all that is left when an archaeological expedition finds this place in a thousand years.\n\nyou have also drank a fair amount of decently priced and tasty wine. you don't really like wine that much (ironic, when you're Italian and your grandfather made it himself; you are more of a beer guy), but hey, let's live like the locals for once.\n\nyou have been to what could be one of the best French restaurants on this continent, and didn't spend a goddamn fortune on it.\n\nyou know what Mr. Sheen meant by \"WINNING\"."]}}}
